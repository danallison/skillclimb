        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does a packet-filtering firewall make access control decisions?
            answer: By evaluating packet headers against a set of rules based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols
            explanation: Packet-filtering firewalls operate at Layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model, examining packet headers (source/destination IP, port numbers, and protocol) against an ordered rule set to allow or deny traffic.
            choices:
              - By inspecting the payload content of each packet for malware signatures
              - By evaluating packet headers against a set of rules based on IP addresses, ports, and protocols
              - By authenticating users before allowing any traffic through
              - By decrypting all encrypted traffic and scanning for threats

            prompt: At which layers of the OSI model does a packet-filtering firewall operate?
            answer: Layers 3 and 4 (Network and Transport)
            explanation: Packet-filtering firewalls operate at Layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model, examining packet headers (source/destination IP, port numbers, and protocol) against an ordered rule set to allow or deny traffic.

              - Layer 3 and Layer 4
              - Network and Transport layers
              - L3 and L4
              - Layers 3-4
            hints:
              - "Think about what information is in a packet header: IP addresses and port numbers."
              - These layers handle addressing/routing and connection management respectively.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain how a packet-filtering firewall works, including what information it examines and how it decides whether to allow or deny traffic.
            answer: A packet-filtering firewall inspects the headers of each network packet at OSI Layers 3 and 4. It examines fields such as source and destination IP addresses, source and destination port numbers, and the protocol type (TCP, UDP, ICMP). The firewall compares these header fields against an ordered set of rules (access control list). Rules are evaluated top-down, and the first matching rule determines whether the packet is allowed or denied. Packets that do not match any rule are handled by a default policy, which in best practice is set to deny.
            explanation: Packet-filtering firewalls operate at Layers 3 and 4 of the OSI model, examining packet headers (source/destination IP, port numbers, and protocol) against an ordered rule set to allow or deny traffic.
            hints:
              - Think about what information exists in a packet header versus the payload.
              - Consider how the firewall processes its rules in sequence.
            rubric: A good answer should identify the OSI layers involved, list the specific header fields examined, explain the rule-matching process, and mention the default policy.
            keyPoints:
              - Operates at OSI Layers 3 (Network) and 4 (Transport)
              - Examines source/destination IP addresses, port numbers, and protocol type
              - Compares packet headers against an ordered rule set (ACL)
              - First matching rule determines the action (allow or deny)
              - Default policy (ideally deny) handles unmatched packets
      - concept: Stateful inspection firewalls
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What key capability distinguishes a stateful inspection firewall from a simple packet filter?
            answer: It tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on connection context
            explanation: Stateful inspection firewalls maintain a state table of active connections. They can determine whether an incoming packet belongs to an established session, automatically allowing legitimate return traffic without requiring explicit rules for each direction.
            choices:
              - It can inspect application-layer content such as HTTP headers
              - It tracks the state of active connections and makes decisions based on connection context
              - It uses machine learning to identify zero-day threats
              - It encrypts all traffic passing through it
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: What data structure does a stateful inspection firewall maintain to track active connections?
            answer: A state table (also called a connection table or session table)
            explanation: Stateful inspection firewalls maintain a state table of active connections. They can determine whether an incoming packet belongs to an established session, automatically allowing legitimate return traffic without requiring explicit rules for each direction.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - State table
              - Connection table
              - Session table
              - State/connection table
            hints:
              - It needs to remember which connections are currently active.
              - The name describes a structured record of the current 'state' of each connection.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Describe how a stateful inspection firewall improves upon a simple packet-filtering firewall. Include how it handles return traffic and connection tracking.
            answer: A stateful inspection firewall improves on simple packet filtering by maintaining a state table that tracks the state of every active network connection. When an outbound connection is initiated and permitted, the firewall records the connection details (source/destination IPs, ports, protocol, TCP sequence numbers, and connection state). When return traffic arrives, the firewall checks whether it belongs to an existing, legitimate connection in the state table. If it does, the traffic is automatically allowed without needing a separate inbound rule. This reduces the number of rules needed, prevents certain attacks like spoofed packets that don't match any known session, and provides better security than stateless packet filtering.
            explanation: Stateful inspection firewalls maintain a state table of active connections. They can determine whether an incoming packet belongs to an established session, automatically allowing legitimate return traffic without requiring explicit rules for each direction.
            hints:
              - Think about why you might not need separate rules for inbound return traffic.
              - Consider what information the firewall remembers about each connection.
            rubric: A good answer should explain the state table concept, how return traffic is handled automatically, the advantage over stateless filtering, and the security benefits of connection tracking.
            keyPoints:
              - Maintains a state table tracking all active connections
              - Records connection details including IPs, ports, protocol, and TCP state
              - Return traffic is automatically permitted if it matches an established session
              - Reduces the number of explicit firewall rules needed
              - Prevents spoofed packets that do not match known sessions
      - concept: Next-generation firewalls (NGFW)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which feature is characteristic of a next-generation firewall (NGFW) but NOT a traditional stateful firewall?
            answer: Deep packet inspection with application awareness and integrated IPS
            explanation: NGFWs combine traditional stateful inspection with application-level awareness, integrated intrusion prevention, and often threat intelligence feeds. They can identify and control applications regardless of the port or protocol used.
            choices:
              - Filtering traffic by source and destination IP address
              - Deep packet inspection with application awareness and integrated IPS
              - Maintaining a state table of active connections
              - Blocking traffic based on port numbers
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: What does the abbreviation NGFW stand for?
            answer: Next-Generation Firewall
            explanation: NGFWs combine traditional stateful inspection with application-level awareness, integrated intrusion prevention, and often threat intelligence feeds. They can identify and control applications regardless of the port or protocol used.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - Next Generation Firewall
              - Next-gen firewall
            hints:
              - It describes a firewall that goes beyond traditional stateful inspection.
              - The 'NG' part refers to an evolution or advancement beyond current technology.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain what makes a next-generation firewall (NGFW) different from a traditional stateful firewall. Describe its key capabilities and why they matter.
            answer: A next-generation firewall (NGFW) extends traditional stateful inspection with several advanced capabilities. First, it performs deep packet inspection (DPI) to analyze the actual content of traffic, not just headers. Second, it provides application awareness, meaning it can identify and control specific applications (like Skype, BitTorrent, or Facebook) regardless of the port or protocol they use. Third, NGFWs integrate intrusion prevention system (IPS) functionality directly into the firewall, allowing it to detect and block known attack signatures and anomalous behavior in real time. Many NGFWs also incorporate threat intelligence feeds for up-to-date information on emerging threats, SSL/TLS inspection to examine encrypted traffic, and user identity awareness to apply policies based on who the user is rather than just their IP address.
            explanation: NGFWs combine traditional stateful inspection with application-level awareness, integrated intrusion prevention, and often threat intelligence feeds. They can identify and control applications regardless of the port or protocol used.
            hints:
              - Think about what a traditional firewall cannot see that an NGFW can.
              - Consider how applications today often use non-standard ports to evade detection.
            rubric: A good answer should cover deep packet inspection, application awareness independent of port/protocol, integrated IPS, and at least one additional advanced feature such as threat intelligence or SSL inspection.
            keyPoints:
              - Performs deep packet inspection (DPI) beyond header analysis
              - Application awareness identifies apps regardless of port or protocol
              - Integrated intrusion prevention system (IPS) for real-time threat blocking
              - Often includes threat intelligence feeds for emerging threats
              - May provide SSL/TLS inspection and user identity awareness
      - concept: Web application firewalls (WAF)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the primary purpose of a Web Application Firewall (WAF)?
            answer: To protect web applications by inspecting and filtering HTTP/HTTPS traffic for attacks like SQL injection and XSS
            explanation: A WAF operates at Layer 7 and is specifically designed to protect web applications. It inspects HTTP/HTTPS traffic and can detect and block attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 threats.
            choices:
              - To filter all network traffic at the IP layer
              - To protect web applications by inspecting and filtering HTTP/HTTPS traffic for attacks like SQL injection and XSS
              - To establish VPN tunnels between branch offices
              - To monitor DNS queries for malicious domains
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: At which OSI layer does a Web Application Firewall (WAF) operate?
            answer: Layer 7 (Application layer)
            explanation: A WAF operates at Layer 7 and is specifically designed to protect web applications. It inspects HTTP/HTTPS traffic and can detect and block attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 threats.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - Layer 7
              - Application layer
              - L7
              - OSI Layer 7
            hints:
              - A WAF inspects HTTP/HTTPS traffic, which is a high-level protocol.
              - This is the topmost layer of the OSI model, where end-user applications communicate.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain the purpose and functionality of a Web Application Firewall (WAF). Include what types of attacks it defends against and how it differs from a traditional network firewall.
            answer: "A Web Application Firewall (WAF) is a security device that operates at OSI Layer 7 (Application layer) to protect web applications from attacks targeting the application logic. Unlike traditional network firewalls that inspect packets at Layers 3-4 based on IP addresses and ports, a WAF inspects the content of HTTP and HTTPS requests and responses. It can detect and block attacks such as SQL injection (inserting malicious SQL into input fields), cross-site scripting (XSS, injecting malicious scripts into web pages), cross-site request forgery (CSRF), file inclusion attacks, and other OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities. WAFs typically operate in one of two modes: negative security model (blocklist of known attack signatures) or positive security model (allowlist of expected valid input patterns). They can be deployed as hardware appliances, software solutions, or cloud-based services."
            explanation: A WAF operates at Layer 7 and is specifically designed to protect web applications. It inspects HTTP/HTTPS traffic and can detect and block attacks such as SQL injection, cross-site scripting (XSS), and other OWASP Top 10 threats.
            hints:
              - Think about attacks that target web forms and URLs rather than network protocols.
              - Consider what kind of traffic a traditional firewall cannot deeply inspect.
            rubric: A good answer should explain that WAFs operate at Layer 7, list specific attack types they defend against (at least SQL injection and XSS), contrast with traditional firewalls, and mention how they inspect HTTP/HTTPS traffic.
            keyPoints:
              - Operates at OSI Layer 7 (Application layer) on HTTP/HTTPS traffic
              - Defends against SQL injection, XSS, CSRF, and other web-based attacks
              - Differs from network firewalls by inspecting application-layer content, not just headers
              - Can use negative (blocklist) or positive (allowlist) security models
              - Protects against OWASP Top 10 vulnerabilities
      - concept: Firewall rule ordering and processing
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is the order of rules in a firewall's access control list (ACL) important?
            answer: Rules are evaluated top-down, and the first matching rule is applied to the packet
            explanation: Firewall rules are processed sequentially from top to bottom. The first rule that matches a packet is applied, and no further rules are evaluated. Placing more specific rules before broader ones ensures correct traffic handling.
            choices:
              - Rules are processed alphabetically, so naming conventions matter
              - Rules are evaluated top-down, and the first matching rule is applied to the packet
              - All rules are evaluated simultaneously and the majority decision wins
              - The order does not matter because the firewall optimizes rules automatically
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: In what order are firewall ACL rules evaluated when a packet arrives?
            answer: Top-down (sequentially from the first rule to the last)
            explanation: Firewall rules are processed sequentially from top to bottom. The first rule that matches a packet is applied, and no further rules are evaluated. Placing more specific rules before broader ones ensures correct traffic handling.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - Top to bottom
              - Top-down
              - Sequential order
              - First to last
              - In order from top to bottom
            hints:
              - Think about how a list of rules would be read if you started from the beginning.
              - Only one rule is applied per packet -- the one encountered first.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain why the order of rules in a firewall access control list (ACL) matters. Describe what can go wrong if rules are ordered incorrectly and what best practices should be followed.
            answer: "Firewall ACL rules are evaluated sequentially from top to bottom, and the first rule that matches an incoming packet is applied -- no further rules are checked after a match is found. This means rule order is critical to correct operation. If a broad 'allow all' rule is placed before a more specific 'deny' rule, the deny rule will never be reached, creating an unintended security gap. Conversely, if an overly broad 'deny' rule is placed too high, it may block legitimate traffic. Best practices include: placing more specific rules before broader ones, putting frequently matched rules near the top for performance, ending the ACL with an explicit default deny rule, regularly reviewing and auditing rule order, and documenting the purpose of each rule."
            explanation: Firewall rules are processed sequentially from top to bottom. The first rule that matches a packet is applied, and no further rules are evaluated. Placing more specific rules before broader ones ensures correct traffic handling.
            hints:
              - Consider what happens if a very broad 'permit any' rule appears before a specific deny rule.
              - Think about both security and performance implications of rule ordering.
            rubric: A good answer should explain top-down evaluation with first-match semantics, give an example of what can go wrong with incorrect ordering, and describe at least two best practices for rule ordering.
            keyPoints:
              - Rules are evaluated top-down with first-match-wins semantics
              - More specific rules must be placed before broader rules
              - Incorrect ordering can create security gaps or block legitimate traffic
              - The ACL should end with an explicit default deny rule
              - Regular review and documentation of rules is important for maintenance
      - concept: Host-based vs. network-based firewalls
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the key difference between a host-based firewall and a network-based firewall?
            answer: Host-based firewalls run on individual devices; network-based firewalls protect entire network segments
            explanation: A host-based firewall (like Windows Firewall or iptables) runs on an individual endpoint and controls traffic to and from that device. A network-based firewall sits at a network boundary and filters traffic for all devices behind it.
            choices:
              - Host-based firewalls run on individual devices; network-based firewalls protect entire network segments
              - Network-based firewalls can only filter inbound traffic; host-based firewalls filter both directions
              - Host-based firewalls are hardware appliances; network-based firewalls are software only
              - Network-based firewalls operate at Layer 7; host-based firewalls operate at Layer 2
      - concept: Proxy firewalls and application-layer filtering
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does a proxy firewall (application-layer gateway) differ from a packet-filtering firewall?
            answer: A proxy firewall terminates and re-establishes connections, inspecting application-layer content
            explanation: A proxy firewall acts as an intermediary, terminating the client connection and creating a new connection to the destination. This allows deep inspection of application-layer data, but introduces additional latency compared to packet filtering.
            choices:
              - A proxy firewall only works with UDP traffic
              - A proxy firewall terminates and re-establishes connections, inspecting application-layer content
              - A proxy firewall is faster because it skips header inspection
              - A proxy firewall cannot log traffic details
      - concept: Firewall zones and trust levels
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: In a zone-based firewall architecture, what determines which traffic policies are applied?
            answer: The zone pair (source zone to destination zone) that the traffic traverses
            explanation: Zone-based firewalls assign interfaces to security zones and apply policies based on zone pairs. Traffic flowing from one zone to another is evaluated against the policy defined for that specific zone pair, allowing granular control over inter-zone communication.
            choices:
              - The MAC addresses of the source and destination devices
              - The zone pair (source zone to destination zone) that the traffic traverses
              - The physical cable type used to connect to the firewall
              - The time of day the traffic is generated
      - concept: Firewall logging and auditing
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is firewall logging important for network security?
            answer: Logs provide a record of allowed and denied traffic for incident investigation, compliance, and policy tuning
            explanation: Firewall logs record details of traffic that was allowed or denied, including timestamps, source and destination addresses, ports, and actions taken. These logs are essential for forensic investigation, regulatory compliance, and refining firewall rules.
            choices:
              - Logs automatically block repeat offenders without administrator intervention
              - Logs provide a record of allowed and denied traffic for incident investigation, compliance, and policy tuning
              - Logs replace the need for intrusion detection systems
              - Logs encrypt traffic records so attackers cannot read them
      - concept: Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliances
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is a Unified Threat Management (UTM) appliance?
            answer: A single appliance that combines firewall, IDS/IPS, antivirus, VPN, and content filtering in one platform
            explanation: UTM appliances consolidate multiple security functions into a single device, simplifying management for small and medium organizations. While convenient, a UTM can become a single point of failure and may have performance limitations under heavy load.
            choices:
              - A device that only performs stateless packet filtering
              - A single appliance that combines firewall, IDS/IPS, antivirus, VPN, and content filtering in one platform
              - A software-only solution that replaces all physical network security devices
              - A dedicated appliance for managing SSL/TLS certificates
      - concept: Default deny vs. default allow firewall policies
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which firewall policy approach is considered a security best practice?
            answer: "Default deny: block all traffic and create rules to explicitly allow required traffic"
            explanation: A default deny policy drops all traffic that is not explicitly permitted by a firewall rule. This least-privilege approach ensures that only known, authorized traffic is allowed, reducing the attack surface compared to a default allow stance.
            choices:
              - "Default allow: permit all traffic and create rules to block known threats"
              - "Default deny: block all traffic and create rules to explicitly allow required traffic"
              - "Mixed mode: allow inbound traffic by default and deny outbound traffic by default"
              - "Adaptive mode: let the firewall learn which traffic to allow over time without rules"
      - concept: Firewall high availability and failover
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the purpose of deploying firewalls in a high-availability (HA) pair?
            answer: To ensure continuous network protection by having a standby firewall take over if the primary fails
            explanation: Firewall HA pairs use active/passive or active/active configurations to provide redundancy. If the primary firewall fails, the secondary takes over with synchronized state information, minimizing downtime and maintaining security policy enforcement.
            choices:
              - To double the throughput of firewall rule processing
              - To ensure continuous network protection by having a standby firewall take over if the primary fails
              - To allow two different firewall policies to run simultaneously
              - To eliminate the need for firewall logging
      - concept: Micro-segmentation firewalls in virtualized environments
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does micro-segmentation achieve in a virtualized or cloud environment?
            answer: It segments traffic at the individual workload level, applying firewall policies between virtual machines
            explanation: Micro-segmentation applies granular security policies at the individual workload or virtual machine level, restricting lateral movement within the data center. This is a key component of zero trust architectures in virtualized and cloud environments.
            choices:
              - It segments traffic at the individual workload level, applying firewall policies between virtual machines
              - It divides the physical network into VLANs only
              - It replaces the need for any perimeter firewall
              - It encrypts all traffic between data centers automatically

            prompt: What is the fundamental difference between an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) and an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS)?
            answer: An IDS passively monitors and alerts on suspicious traffic; an IPS actively blocks or drops malicious traffic
            explanation: An IDS detects potential intrusions and generates alerts for analysts to review. An IPS sits inline in the traffic path and can automatically drop or block packets identified as malicious, providing active prevention.
            choices:
              - An IDS encrypts traffic; an IPS decrypts traffic
              - An IDS passively monitors and alerts on suspicious traffic; an IPS actively blocks or drops malicious traffic
              - An IDS works at Layer 2; an IPS works at Layer 7
              - An IDS is hardware-based; an IPS is software-based
      - concept: Signature-based detection
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does signature-based intrusion detection work?
            answer: It compares network traffic against a database of known attack patterns
            explanation: Signature-based detection matches network traffic or system activity against a database of known attack signatures (patterns). It is very effective at detecting known threats but cannot identify novel or zero-day attacks that have no existing signature.
            choices:
              - It compares network traffic against a database of known attack patterns
              - It builds a baseline of normal traffic and alerts on deviations
              - It uses machine learning to predict future attacks
              - It monitors CPU usage on endpoints to detect compromise
      - concept: Anomaly-based detection
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is a key advantage of anomaly-based intrusion detection over signature-based detection?
            answer: It can detect previously unknown attacks by identifying deviations from normal behavior
            explanation: Anomaly-based detection establishes a baseline of normal network or system behavior and alerts when activity deviates significantly from that baseline. This enables detection of novel attacks, though it typically produces more false positives than signature-based methods.
            choices:
              - It has a lower false positive rate
              - It can detect previously unknown attacks by identifying deviations from normal behavior
              - It requires no initial configuration or training
              - It is faster at processing high volumes of traffic
      - concept: Network-based IDS (NIDS) placement
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Where is a network-based IDS (NIDS) sensor typically placed to monitor traffic?
            answer: Connected to a SPAN port or network TAP to capture copies of network traffic
            explanation: A NIDS sensor is connected to a SPAN (mirror) port on a switch or a network TAP to passively receive copies of traffic flowing through the network. This allows it to analyze traffic without being inline and without impacting network performance.
            choices:
              - On each individual endpoint as a software agent
              - Connected to a SPAN port or network TAP to capture copies of network traffic
              - Between the ISP and the internet backbone router
              - Inside the database server to monitor queries
      - concept: Host-based IDS (HIDS)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does a host-based intrusion detection system (HIDS) primarily monitor?
            answer: Activities on the individual host, such as file changes, log entries, and system calls
            explanation: A HIDS runs on an individual host and monitors local activities including file system changes, log files, registry modifications, and system calls. OSSEC and Tripwire are well-known HIDS solutions.
            choices:
              - All traffic flowing through the network switches
              - Activities on the individual host, such as file changes, log entries, and system calls
              - Wireless access point signal strength and channel interference
              - DNS resolution requests across the entire network
      - concept: False positives and false negatives in IDS
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: In the context of intrusion detection, what is a false positive?
            answer: Legitimate traffic that the IDS incorrectly flags as malicious
            explanation: A false positive occurs when the IDS generates an alert for benign activity, mistakenly identifying it as an attack. Excessive false positives cause alert fatigue, which can lead analysts to overlook genuine threats (true positives).
            choices:
              - A real attack that the IDS successfully detects and alerts on
              - Legitimate traffic that the IDS incorrectly flags as malicious
              - A real attack that the IDS fails to detect
              - An alert that is generated after the attack has already succeeded
      - concept: Inline vs. passive IPS deployment
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why must an IPS be deployed inline (in the traffic path) to function correctly?
            answer: So it can actively drop or block malicious packets before they reach their destination
            explanation: An IPS must sit inline in the traffic path so it can inspect packets and take action (drop, reset, or quarantine) before they reach the target. A passive deployment (like an IDS) can only alert on threats, not prevent them.
            choices:
              - So it can encrypt all traffic before forwarding it
              - So it can actively drop or block malicious packets before they reach their destination
              - So it can increase network bandwidth by compressing packets
              - So it can assign IP addresses to new devices on the network
      - concept: Snort as an open-source IDS/IPS
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is Snort?
            answer: An open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system that uses signature-based rules
            explanation: Snort is one of the most widely used open-source IDS/IPS platforms. It performs real-time traffic analysis and packet logging, using community-maintained and commercial rule sets to detect a wide range of attacks and suspicious activity.
            choices:
              - A commercial-only firewall platform with no community edition
              - An open-source network intrusion detection and prevention system that uses signature-based rules
              - A proprietary endpoint detection and response (EDR) tool
              - A DNS security service that blocks malicious domains
      - concept: Suricata and multi-threaded IDS/IPS processing
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is a key technical advantage of Suricata over traditional single-threaded IDS/IPS solutions?
            answer: Suricata supports multi-threaded processing, enabling higher throughput on modern hardware
            explanation: Suricata is an open-source IDS/IPS engine designed with multi-threading support, allowing it to leverage multiple CPU cores for parallel packet processing. This provides significantly higher throughput than single-threaded engines on modern multi-core systems.
            choices:
              - Suricata can only process encrypted traffic
              - Suricata supports multi-threaded processing, enabling higher throughput on modern hardware
              - Suricata does not require any rule sets to operate
              - Suricata replaces the need for firewalls entirely
      - concept: IDS evasion techniques
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which technique is commonly used by attackers to evade network-based intrusion detection?
            answer: Fragmenting packets or using protocol-level obfuscation to avoid signature matching
            explanation: Attackers use techniques such as packet fragmentation, payload encoding, session splicing, and protocol-level obfuscation to split or disguise attack signatures across multiple packets, making it harder for the IDS to match known patterns.
            choices:
              - Sending all traffic over port 80 since IDS ignores HTTP
              - Fragmenting packets or using protocol-level obfuscation to avoid signature matching
              - Connecting only during business hours when IDS is disabled
              - Using longer passwords for authentication
      - concept: IDS/IPS rule tuning and management
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is ongoing rule tuning important for an IDS/IPS deployment?
            answer: To reduce false positives and ensure new threats are detected while minimizing alert fatigue
            explanation: Regular rule tuning adjusts detection thresholds, disables irrelevant rules, and adds signatures for newly discovered threats. This minimizes false positives (which cause alert fatigue) and false negatives (which miss real attacks), keeping the system effective.
            choices:
              - To increase network latency for security purposes
              - To reduce false positives and ensure new threats are detected while minimizing alert fatigue
              - To remove the need for firewall rules
              - To automatically apply patches to vulnerable systems
      - concept: Protocol analysis in IDS
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is protocol analysis (protocol decoding) in the context of an IDS?
            answer: Parsing network protocols to understand their structure and detect protocol violations or misuse
            explanation: Protocol analysis involves the IDS parsing the structure of network protocols (HTTP, DNS, SMB, etc.) to verify conformance to standards. Deviations or anomalies in protocol behavior may indicate an attack such as buffer overflow or protocol exploitation.
            choices:
              - Converting all traffic to a single protocol for simplified inspection
              - Parsing network protocols to understand their structure and detect protocol violations or misuse
              - Encrypting protocols to prevent eavesdropping
              - Assigning priority levels to different protocols for quality of service
      - concept: Reputation-based threat intelligence in IPS
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How do reputation-based threat intelligence feeds enhance IPS effectiveness?
            answer: They provide regularly updated lists of known malicious IPs, domains, and URLs for automatic blocking
            explanation: Threat intelligence feeds supply continuously updated information about known malicious indicators (IP addresses, domains, file hashes). An IPS can use these feeds to automatically block connections to or from known bad actors, complementing signature and anomaly detection.
            choices:
              - They encrypt all traffic from known malicious sources
              - They provide regularly updated lists of known malicious IPs, domains, and URLs for automatic blocking
              - They replace the need for signature-based detection entirely
              - They increase the bandwidth available for legitimate traffic
  - name: Network Segmentation
    complexityWeight: 1.1
    nodes:
      - concept: The purpose of network segmentation
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the primary security benefit of network segmentation?
            answer: It limits lateral movement by isolating network zones, reducing the blast radius of a breach
            explanation: Network segmentation divides a network into smaller, isolated zones. If an attacker compromises one segment, segmentation limits their ability to move laterally to other parts of the network, containing the damage and protecting critical assets.
            choices:
              - It increases internet bandwidth for all segments
              - It limits lateral movement by isolating network zones, reducing the blast radius of a breach
              - It eliminates the need for firewalls between segments
              - It automatically encrypts all inter-segment traffic
      - concept: VLANs and their role in segmentation
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How do VLANs (Virtual Local Area Networks) contribute to network segmentation?
            answer: VLANs logically separate broadcast domains on the same physical switch infrastructure
            explanation: VLANs create separate broadcast domains within the same physical switch, logically isolating groups of devices. Traffic between VLANs must pass through a router or Layer 3 switch, where access control policies can be enforced.
            choices:
              - VLANs encrypt traffic between network segments
              - VLANs logically separate broadcast domains on the same physical switch infrastructure
              - VLANs replace the need for IP addressing within a network
              - VLANs provide wireless access to segmented networks
      - concept: VLAN hopping attacks
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is VLAN hopping?
            answer: An attack where an attacker gains access to traffic on other VLANs by exploiting trunk port configurations
            explanation: VLAN hopping exploits misconfigured trunk ports or uses switch spoofing / double tagging to send traffic to VLANs the attacker should not have access to. Mitigations include disabling unused ports, setting access ports explicitly, and disabling DTP (Dynamic Trunking Protocol).
            choices:
              - An attack where an attacker gains access to traffic on other VLANs by exploiting trunk port configurations
              - A legitimate method for routing traffic between VLANs using a Layer 3 switch
              - A technique for increasing VLAN throughput by bonding multiple ports
              - A protocol for dynamically assigning devices to VLANs
      - concept: DMZ architecture for public-facing services
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why are public-facing servers typically placed in a DMZ rather than on the internal network?
            answer: The DMZ isolates public-facing services so that a compromise does not grant direct access to internal resources
            explanation: A DMZ provides a buffer zone between the untrusted internet and the trusted internal network. If a public-facing server in the DMZ is compromised, the attacker is still separated from internal systems by an additional firewall, limiting the impact.
            choices:
              - DMZ servers have faster internet connections than internal servers
              - The DMZ isolates public-facing services so that a compromise does not grant direct access to internal resources
              - DMZ servers do not require any firewall rules
              - Placing servers in the DMZ eliminates the need for patching
      - concept: Zero trust network architecture principles
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the core principle of a zero trust network architecture?
            answer: "Never trust, always verify: authenticate and authorize every access request regardless of network location"
            explanation: Zero trust assumes no implicit trust based on network location. Every user, device, and connection must be continuously authenticated, authorized, and validated before being granted access to resources, whether inside or outside the network perimeter.
            choices:
              - Trust all traffic that originates from inside the corporate network
              - "Never trust, always verify: authenticate and authorize every access request regardless of network location"
              - Replace all firewalls with intrusion detection systems
              - Allow unrestricted access between network segments after initial authentication
      - concept: Network Access Control (NAC)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the primary function of Network Access Control (NAC)?
            answer: Enforcing security policy compliance before granting devices access to the network
            explanation: NAC evaluates devices attempting to connect to the network, checking factors like antivirus status, OS patch level, and authentication credentials. Non-compliant devices can be denied access, placed in a quarantine VLAN, or given limited connectivity until remediated.
            choices:
              - Encrypting all network traffic at the physical layer
              - Enforcing security policy compliance before granting devices access to the network
              - Routing traffic between VLANs automatically
              - Providing DNS resolution for internal hosts
      - concept: Air-gapped networks
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is an air-gapped network?
            answer: A network physically isolated from the internet and other unsecured networks with no direct connectivity
            explanation: An air-gapped network has no physical or logical connection to external networks, including the internet. This extreme form of segmentation is used for highly sensitive systems such as classified military networks, SCADA/ICS systems, and critical infrastructure.
            choices:
              - A network that uses wireless bridges instead of physical cables
              - A network physically isolated from the internet and other unsecured networks with no direct connectivity
              - A network that uses VPNs to connect all remote sites
              - A network with redundant firewalls for high availability
      - concept: 802.1X port-based authentication
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does IEEE 802.1X provide in network security?
            answer: Port-based network access control that requires authentication before a device can communicate on the LAN
            explanation: IEEE 802.1X is a port-based network access control standard. It prevents devices from accessing the network through a switch port until they successfully authenticate via a RADIUS server. The switch port remains unauthorized until the supplicant (client) provides valid credentials.
            choices:
              - Wireless encryption using WPA3 protocols
              - Port-based network access control that requires authentication before a device can communicate on the LAN
              - Automatic IP address assignment using DHCP
              - Layer 3 routing between VLANs
      - concept: Private VLANs (PVLANs)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What additional isolation do Private VLANs (PVLANs) provide beyond standard VLANs?
            answer: PVLANs restrict communication between hosts within the same VLAN, allowing isolation at the port level
            explanation: Private VLANs subdivide a standard VLAN into isolated and community ports. Isolated ports cannot communicate with each other, only with promiscuous (uplink) ports. This is commonly used in hosting environments to prevent co-tenants from accessing each other's traffic.
            choices:
              - PVLANs encrypt traffic between ports on the same VLAN
              - PVLANs restrict communication between hosts within the same VLAN, allowing isolation at the port level
              - PVLANs automatically assign different IP subnets to each port
              - PVLANs eliminate the need for a default gateway
      - concept: East-west vs. north-south traffic
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: In data center terminology, what does 'east-west traffic' refer to?
            answer: Traffic flowing laterally between servers or workloads within the data center
            explanation: East-west traffic refers to lateral communication between servers, virtual machines, or containers within the data center. North-south traffic flows between the data center and external networks. Modern segmentation strategies focus heavily on controlling east-west traffic to prevent lateral movement.
            choices:
              - Traffic flowing between the data center and the internet
              - Traffic flowing laterally between servers or workloads within the data center
              - Traffic between the data center and remote branch offices
              - Traffic between the primary and disaster recovery sites
      - concept: Software-defined networking (SDN) for segmentation
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does software-defined networking (SDN) improve network segmentation?
            answer: SDN centralizes control plane management, enabling dynamic and programmable segmentation policies
            explanation: SDN separates the control plane from the data plane, allowing administrators to define and modify segmentation policies centrally through software. This enables rapid, automated policy changes across the network without manual switch-by-switch configuration.
            choices:
              - SDN replaces all physical switches with virtual switches
              - SDN centralizes control plane management, enabling dynamic and programmable segmentation policies
              - SDN eliminates the need for VLANs entirely
              - SDN provides hardware-level encryption for all network segments
      - concept: Segmentation for PCI DSS compliance
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is network segmentation important for PCI DSS compliance?
            answer: Segmentation reduces the scope of the cardholder data environment (CDE), simplifying compliance requirements
            explanation: While not strictly required by PCI DSS, network segmentation isolates systems that store, process, or transmit cardholder data. This reduces the scope of the CDE, meaning fewer systems need to meet PCI DSS requirements, lowering cost and complexity of compliance.
            choices:
              - PCI DSS requires all network traffic to be encrypted with TLS 1.3
              - Segmentation reduces the scope of the cardholder data environment (CDE), simplifying compliance requirements
              - Segmentation is optional under PCI DSS and provides no compliance benefit
              - PCI DSS requires air-gapped networks for all payment systems
      - concept: Lateral movement and segmentation as a defense
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does network segmentation help defend against lateral movement by attackers?
            answer: It places barriers between network zones, requiring the attacker to bypass additional access controls to reach other segments
            explanation: After initial compromise, attackers attempt lateral movement to access additional systems and data. Segmentation creates boundaries with enforced access controls, so the attacker must find ways to bypass additional firewalls, ACLs, or authentication mechanisms to pivot between zones.
            choices:
              - It encrypts credentials so they cannot be stolen during lateral movement
              - It places barriers between network zones, requiring the attacker to bypass additional access controls to reach other segments
              - It prevents all traffic between segments, including legitimate traffic
              - It automatically patches vulnerable systems in each segment
  - name: VPN Technologies
    complexityWeight: 1.2
    nodes:
      - concept: What a VPN does and why it is used
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the primary purpose of a Virtual Private Network (VPN)?
            answer: To create an encrypted tunnel over an untrusted network, providing secure remote access or site-to-site connectivity
            explanation: A VPN creates an encrypted tunnel over a public or untrusted network (such as the internet), allowing remote users or branch offices to securely access private network resources as if they were directly connected to the internal network.
            choices:
              - To increase internet connection speed by compressing data
              - To create an encrypted tunnel over an untrusted network, providing secure remote access or site-to-site connectivity
              - To assign public IP addresses to internal devices
              - To replace firewalls for network security
      - concept: IPsec VPN and its core protocols
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which two core protocols does IPsec use to secure network communications?
            answer: AH (Authentication Header) and ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)
            explanation: IPsec uses AH for authentication and integrity (without encryption) and ESP for authentication, integrity, and confidentiality (encryption). ESP is more commonly used because it provides encryption in addition to authentication.
            choices:
              - HTTP and HTTPS
              - AH (Authentication Header) and ESP (Encapsulating Security Payload)
              - TCP and UDP
              - SSL and TLS
      - concept: IPsec tunnel mode vs. transport mode
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the difference between IPsec tunnel mode and transport mode?
            answer: Tunnel mode encapsulates and encrypts the entire original IP packet with a new header; transport mode encrypts only the payload
            explanation: In tunnel mode, the entire original IP packet is encrypted and encapsulated within a new IP packet with new headers, commonly used for site-to-site VPNs. Transport mode encrypts only the payload, leaving the original IP header intact, typically used for host-to-host communication.
            choices:
              - Tunnel mode encrypts only the payload; transport mode encrypts the entire packet including the original IP header
              - Tunnel mode encapsulates and encrypts the entire original IP packet with a new header; transport mode encrypts only the payload
              - There is no difference; both modes encrypt traffic identically

      - concept: Split tunneling vs. full tunneling
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is split tunneling in a VPN configuration?
            answer: Routing only corporate-destined traffic through the VPN tunnel while allowing internet traffic to go directly to the internet
            explanation: Split tunneling routes only traffic destined for corporate resources through the VPN tunnel, while internet-bound traffic goes directly out the user's local internet connection. This reduces VPN bandwidth usage but creates a potential security risk since internet traffic bypasses corporate security controls.
            choices:
              - Routing all traffic through the VPN tunnel, including internet-bound traffic
              - Routing only corporate-destined traffic through the VPN tunnel while allowing internet traffic to go directly to the internet

      - concept: NetFlow and flow-based traffic analysis
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does NetFlow (or IPFIX) provide for network traffic analysis?
            answer: Summarized metadata about network conversations including source/destination IPs, ports, protocols, and byte counts
            explanation: NetFlow collects metadata about network flows (conversations) rather than full packet payloads. Each flow record includes source and destination IPs, ports, protocol, timestamps, and byte/packet counts. This provides visibility into traffic patterns without the storage overhead of full packet capture.

      - concept: Deep packet inspection (DPI)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What distinguishes deep packet inspection (DPI) from basic packet filtering?
            answer: DPI examines the data payload of packets in addition to headers, enabling content-level analysis
            explanation: Deep packet inspection goes beyond header analysis to examine the actual data payload of packets. This enables identification of applications, detection of malware, enforcement of content policies, and detection of protocol anomalies that header-only inspection would miss.
            choices:
              - DPI only examines packet headers, while basic filtering examines payloads
              - DPI examines the data payload of packets in addition to headers, enabling content-level analysis

              - DPI can only analyze encrypted traffic
      - concept: Baseline traffic analysis for anomaly detection
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is establishing a network traffic baseline important for security?
            answer: It defines normal traffic patterns so that deviations indicating attacks or misconfigurations can be identified
            explanation: A traffic baseline documents normal network behavior including typical traffic volumes, protocols, peak hours, and communication patterns. Security teams compare current traffic against this baseline to identify anomalies that may indicate compromise, data exfiltration, or misconfiguration.
            choices:
              - It determines the maximum bandwidth the network can handle

              - It automatically blocks all traffic that exceeds the baseline
              - It replaces the need for firewall rules
      - concept: Identifying command and control (C2) traffic
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which traffic pattern may indicate command and control (C2) activity on a network?
            answer: Regular, periodic beaconing to an external IP address with small, consistent packet sizes
            explanation: C2 traffic often exhibits periodic beaconing patterns where compromised hosts check in with the attacker's server at regular intervals. These connections typically have small, consistent packet sizes and may use unusual ports, DNS tunneling, or HTTPS to blend in with normal traffic.
            choices:
              - High-volume file transfers during scheduled backup windows
              - Regular, periodic beaconing to an external IP address with small, consistent packet sizes
              - Increased DNS queries when employees arrive at work
              - Large downloads from well-known software update servers
      - concept: DNS traffic analysis for threat detection
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What suspicious indicator in DNS traffic might suggest data exfiltration or tunneling?
            answer: Unusually long subdomain strings or high volumes of TXT record queries to uncommon domains
            explanation: DNS tunneling encodes data in DNS queries and responses, often using very long subdomain labels or TXT records. High query volumes to unusual domains, queries with encoded or random-looking subdomains, and abnormal record types are indicators of DNS-based data exfiltration.
            choices:
              - DNS queries for well-known domains like google.com
              - Unusually long subdomain strings or high volumes of TXT record queries to uncommon domains
              - Standard A record lookups for internal servers
              - DNS responses with normal TTL values

        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What challenge does widespread TLS encryption pose for network traffic analysis?
            answer: TLS prevents inspection of payload content, limiting visibility into encrypted communications for threat detection
            explanation: TLS encryption prevents security tools from inspecting packet payloads, making it difficult to detect malware, data exfiltration, or policy violations within encrypted traffic. Solutions include TLS inspection proxies, endpoint detection, and analyzing metadata (JA3 fingerprints, certificate details, traffic patterns).
            choices:
              - TLS makes packets larger, causing network congestion
              - TLS prevents inspection of payload content, limiting visibility into encrypted communications for threat detection
              - TLS changes the source IP address of all packets
              - TLS prevents NetFlow from collecting flow metadata

        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does JA3 fingerprinting identify in network traffic?
            answer: The unique TLS client hello parameters to fingerprint the application or malware making the connection
            explanation: JA3 creates an MD5 hash from specific fields in the TLS Client Hello message (SSL version, ciphers, extensions, elliptic curves). This fingerprint identifies the client application or library, enabling detection of known malware that uses distinctive TLS implementations.
            choices:
              - The geographic location of a TLS server
              - The unique TLS client hello parameters to fingerprint the application or malware making the connection
              - The encryption key used in a TLS session
              - The certificate authority that issued the server's certificate

  - name: DNS Security
    complexityWeight: 1.2
    nodes:
      - concept: DNS as an attack vector
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is DNS frequently targeted by attackers?
            answer: DNS is a foundational service that is often trusted and allowed through firewalls, making it useful for tunneling and exfiltration
            explanation: DNS is critical for network functionality and its traffic (port 53) is almost universally allowed through firewalls. Attackers exploit this trust to tunnel data through DNS queries, exfiltrate information, redirect users to malicious sites, and communicate with command and control infrastructure.
            choices:
              - DNS traffic is always encrypted, making attacks undetectable
              - DNS is a foundational service that is often trusted and allowed through firewalls, making it useful for tunneling and exfiltration
              - DNS servers store user passwords and authentication tokens
              - DNS only runs on easily compromised legacy systems
      - concept: DNSSEC for response authentication
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does DNSSEC protect against?
            answer: DNS response spoofing and cache poisoning by cryptographically signing DNS records
            explanation: DNSSEC adds digital signatures to DNS records, allowing resolvers to verify that responses are authentic and have not been tampered with. This prevents cache poisoning and response spoofing attacks. Note that DNSSEC provides integrity and authenticity but does not encrypt DNS traffic.
            choices:
              - Eavesdropping on DNS queries in transit
              - DNS response spoofing and cache poisoning by cryptographically signing DNS records
              - DDoS attacks targeting DNS servers

        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the primary benefit of DNS over HTTPS (DoH)?
            answer: It encrypts DNS queries within HTTPS traffic, preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS lookups
            explanation: DNS over HTTPS (DoH) encrypts DNS queries and responses within standard HTTPS connections (port 443). This prevents ISPs, network operators, and attackers on the path from seeing or modifying DNS lookups, enhancing user privacy. However, it can also bypass enterprise DNS security controls.
            choices:
              - It speeds up DNS resolution by caching results locally
              - It encrypts DNS queries within HTTPS traffic, preventing eavesdropping and manipulation of DNS lookups
              - It eliminates the need for DNSSEC
              - It allows DNS servers to block malicious websites automatically
      - concept: DNS over TLS (DoT)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does DNS over TLS (DoT) differ from DNS over HTTPS (DoH)?
            answer: DoT uses a dedicated port (853) for encrypted DNS, while DoH wraps DNS in HTTPS on port 443
            explanation: DoT encrypts DNS using TLS on dedicated port 853, making it easy for network administrators to identify and manage encrypted DNS traffic. DoH uses port 443, blending in with regular HTTPS traffic, which provides more privacy but makes enterprise monitoring more difficult.
            choices:
              - DoT does not encrypt DNS traffic
              - DoT uses a dedicated port (853) for encrypted DNS, while DoH wraps DNS in HTTPS on port 443
              - DoT is faster because it does not use encryption
              - DoT can only be used on internal networks
      - concept: DNS sinkholing
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is DNS sinkholing?
            answer: Redirecting DNS queries for known malicious domains to a controlled IP address to prevent access and enable monitoring
            explanation: DNS sinkholing intercepts DNS queries for known malicious domains and returns a controlled IP address instead of the real one. This prevents compromised systems from communicating with C2 servers and allows security teams to identify infected hosts by monitoring connections to the sinkhole.
            choices:
              - Deleting DNS records to take a domain offline
              - Redirecting DNS queries for known malicious domains to a controlled IP address to prevent access and enable monitoring
              - Flooding a DNS server with queries to cause denial of service
              - Transferring DNS zone files to an unauthorized server
      - concept: DNS tunneling attacks
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does DNS tunneling work as a data exfiltration technique?
            answer: By encoding data within DNS query names and response records to bypass firewalls and exfiltrate information
            explanation: DNS tunneling encodes data into DNS queries (typically as subdomain labels) and responses (often using TXT or NULL records). Since DNS traffic is usually allowed through firewalls, attackers can use this covert channel to exfiltrate data or establish C2 communications.
            choices:
              - By exploiting buffer overflows in DNS server software
              - By encoding data within DNS query names and response records to bypass firewalls and exfiltrate information
              - By redirecting DNS traffic to use TCP instead of UDP
              - By creating fake DNS root servers
      - concept: Response Policy Zones (RPZ) for DNS filtering
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What are Response Policy Zones (RPZ) used for in DNS security?
            answer: Defining policies that override DNS responses for specific domains, enabling blocking of malicious or unwanted domains
            explanation: RPZ allows DNS administrators to define custom policies that modify DNS responses for specific domains. This enables blocking access to known malicious domains, phishing sites, or policy-violating content by returning NXDOMAIN, a sinkhole address, or other controlled responses.
            choices:
              - Encrypting DNS responses to prevent interception
              - Defining policies that override DNS responses for specific domains, enabling blocking of malicious or unwanted domains
              - Balancing load across multiple DNS servers
              - Automatically updating DNSSEC signatures
      - concept: DNS amplification DDoS attacks
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does a DNS amplification DDoS attack work?
            answer: By sending small DNS queries with a spoofed source IP (the victim's), causing large responses to flood the victim
            explanation: In a DNS amplification attack, the attacker sends DNS queries to open resolvers with the source IP spoofed to the victim's address. The DNS responses (which can be much larger than the queries) are sent to the victim, overwhelming their bandwidth. Amplification factors of 50x or more are possible.
            choices:
              - By poisoning DNS caches to redirect traffic to the victim
              - By sending small DNS queries with a spoofed source IP (the victim's), causing large responses to flood the victim
              - By exhausting the DNS server's connection pool with incomplete TCP handshakes
              - By deleting DNS records so the victim's domain becomes unreachable
      - concept: Protective DNS services
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What do protective DNS services (such as Quad9 or Cloudflare Gateway) provide?
            answer: DNS resolution that blocks queries to known malicious domains, providing a first layer of defense
            explanation: Protective DNS services maintain threat intelligence feeds and block DNS resolution for known malicious, phishing, or malware-hosting domains. By pointing resolvers to these services, organizations gain an additional security layer that can prevent users from reaching harmful destinations.
            choices:
              - Free domain registration for organizations
              - DNS resolution that blocks queries to known malicious domains, providing a first layer of defense
              - Automatic DNSSEC signing for all domains
              - VPN tunneling through DNS for anonymous browsing
      - concept: DNS zone transfer security
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why should DNS zone transfers (AXFR) be restricted?
            answer: Unrestricted zone transfers expose all DNS records in a zone, giving attackers a complete map of the organization's hosts and services
            explanation: A DNS zone transfer (AXFR) copies all records from a DNS zone. If unrestricted, attackers can enumerate all hostnames, IP addresses, and service records, providing valuable reconnaissance information. Zone transfers should be restricted to authorized secondary DNS servers only.
            choices:
              - Zone transfers consume too much bandwidth for regular use
              - Unrestricted zone transfers expose all DNS records in a zone, giving attackers a complete map of the organization's hosts and services
              - Zone transfers automatically delete records from the primary server
              - Zone transfers encrypt records, making them unreadable
      - concept: Domain generation algorithms (DGA) in malware
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What are domain generation algorithms (DGAs) used for in malware?
            answer: To algorithmically generate large numbers of pseudo-random domain names for C2 communication, making blocking difficult
            explanation: DGAs generate hundreds or thousands of pseudo-random domain names that the malware tries to resolve. The attacker only needs to register a few of these domains to establish C2 communication. The high volume of potential domains makes static blacklisting impractical; detection requires behavioral analysis.
            choices:
              - To generate legitimate SSL certificates for phishing sites
              - To algorithmically generate large numbers of pseudo-random domain names for C2 communication, making blocking difficult
              - To speed up DNS resolution for the malware's network traffic
              - To encrypt DNS queries so they cannot be inspected
      - concept: Split-horizon DNS (split DNS)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is split-horizon DNS (split DNS)?
            answer: A DNS configuration that provides different answers depending on whether the query comes from internal or external networks
            explanation: Split-horizon DNS returns different DNS records depending on the source of the query. Internal users may receive private IP addresses, while external users receive public IPs. This prevents exposure of internal network topology to the outside world while providing seamless name resolution for internal users.
            choices:
              - A DNS configuration that provides different answers depending on whether the query comes from internal or external networks
              - A technique for distributing DNS queries across multiple servers for load balancing
              - A method for encrypting DNS traffic between internal and external resolvers
              - A redundancy technique that maintains identical DNS zones on two separate servers
  - name: Wireless Security
    complexityWeight: 1.3
    nodes:
      - concept: WPA3 and its improvements over WPA2
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What key security improvement does WPA3 provide over WPA2?
            answer: WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which protects against offline dictionary attacks on the handshake
            explanation: WPA3 replaces WPA2's Pre-Shared Key (PSK) handshake with SAE (also known as Dragonfly), which provides protection against offline dictionary attacks. Even if an attacker captures the handshake, they cannot perform offline brute-force attacks against the password.
            choices:
              - WPA3 uses faster wireless frequencies
              - WPA3 uses Simultaneous Authentication of Equals (SAE), which protects against offline dictionary attacks on the handshake
              - WPA3 eliminates the need for passwords entirely
              - WPA3 only works with 5 GHz wireless bands
      - concept: WEP and why it is insecure
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is WEP (Wired Equivalent Privacy) considered fundamentally broken?
            answer: WEP uses the RC4 cipher with weak initialization vectors (IVs), allowing the key to be recovered by capturing enough traffic
            explanation: WEP uses 24-bit initialization vectors (IVs) with the RC4 stream cipher. The short IV space leads to IV reuse, and cryptographic weaknesses allow attackers to recover the WEP key by capturing a sufficient number of packets. WEP can be cracked in minutes with modern tools.
            choices:
              - WEP uses too long of an encryption key, causing performance issues
              - WEP uses the RC4 cipher with weak initialization vectors (IVs), allowing the key to be recovered by capturing enough traffic
              - WEP requires manual key exchange, which is inconvenient
              - WEP does not support any form of authentication
      - concept: Evil twin access point attacks
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is an evil twin attack in wireless networking?
            answer: An attacker sets up a rogue access point mimicking a legitimate network to intercept user traffic
            explanation: In an evil twin attack, the attacker creates a fake access point with the same SSID as a legitimate network. Unsuspecting users connect to the rogue AP, allowing the attacker to intercept credentials, inject malware, or perform man-in-the-middle attacks on all their traffic.
            choices:
              - An attack where two users share the same wireless credentials simultaneously
              - An attacker sets up a rogue access point mimicking a legitimate network to intercept user traffic
              - An attack that jams all wireless frequencies in an area
              - An attack that duplicates MAC addresses to bypass authentication
      - concept: Wireless deauthentication attacks
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is a wireless deauthentication attack?
            answer: Sending forged deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from an access point
            explanation: Deauthentication attacks exploit the unencrypted management frames in 802.11 to send forged deauth packets, forcing clients to disconnect from the AP. This can be used as a denial-of-service attack or to force clients to reconnect through an evil twin AP. 802.11w (PMF) mitigates this.
            choices:
              - An attack that changes the SSID of a wireless network
              - Sending forged deauthentication frames to disconnect clients from an access point
              - An attack that encrypts all wireless traffic with the attacker's key
              - An attack that physically disables wireless access points
      - concept: WPA2-Enterprise and 802.1X authentication
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What advantage does WPA2-Enterprise have over WPA2-Personal?
            answer: WPA2-Enterprise authenticates each user individually via 802.1X and a RADIUS server, rather than using a shared password
            explanation: WPA2-Enterprise uses IEEE 802.1X and a RADIUS authentication server to authenticate each user individually with unique credentials (username/password, certificates, or tokens). This eliminates the shared password vulnerability of WPA2-Personal and provides per-user key derivation.
            choices:
              - WPA2-Enterprise uses stronger encryption algorithms
              - WPA2-Enterprise authenticates each user individually via 802.1X and a RADIUS server, rather than using a shared password
              - WPA2-Enterprise does not require an access point
              - WPA2-Enterprise is faster because it skips the authentication step
      - concept: Rogue access point detection
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is a rogue access point?
            answer: An unauthorized access point connected to the network, potentially bypassing security controls
            explanation: A rogue access point is an unauthorized AP connected to the corporate network, either maliciously by an attacker or inadvertently by an employee. It can bypass network security controls and provide unauthorized access to the internal network. Wireless IDS (WIDS) can detect rogue APs.
            choices:
              - An access point that has been updated with the latest firmware
              - An unauthorized access point connected to the network, potentially bypassing security controls
              - A backup access point used for failover
              - An access point configured with WPA3 encryption
      - concept: SSID broadcasting and hiding
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Is hiding the SSID (disabling SSID broadcast) an effective security measure?
            answer: No, the SSID is still transmitted in probe requests and responses and can be easily discovered with wireless analysis tools
            explanation: Hiding the SSID only removes it from beacon frames. The SSID is still visible in probe requests from clients and probe responses from the AP, making it trivial to discover with tools like Wireshark or Kismet. SSID hiding provides no real security and is considered security through obscurity.
            choices:
              - Yes, it makes the network completely invisible and secure
              - No, the SSID is still transmitted in probe requests and responses and can be easily discovered with wireless analysis tools
              - Yes, but only if combined with WEP encryption
              - No, because SSID hiding is not supported by modern access points
      - concept: MAC address filtering limitations
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is MAC address filtering alone insufficient for wireless security?
            answer: MAC addresses can be easily spoofed by an attacker who observes legitimate MAC addresses on the network
            explanation: MAC addresses are transmitted in cleartext in wireless frames and can be observed by anyone with a wireless sniffer. An attacker can easily change (spoof) their MAC address to match a whitelisted device, bypassing MAC filtering entirely. It should not be relied upon as a primary security control.
            choices:
              - MAC addresses are encrypted and cannot be read by the access point
              - MAC addresses can be easily spoofed by an attacker who observes legitimate MAC addresses on the network
              - MAC addresses change every time a device connects to a network
              - MAC filtering only works with IPv6 networks
      - concept: Wireless intrusion detection systems (WIDS)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does a wireless intrusion detection system (WIDS) monitor for?
            answer: Rogue access points, unauthorized clients, deauthentication attacks, and other wireless threats
            explanation: A WIDS uses dedicated sensors to monitor the wireless spectrum for security threats including rogue access points, evil twins, unauthorized clients, deauthentication attacks, and policy violations. It provides visibility into the wireless environment that wired security tools cannot offer.
            choices:
              - Wired network traffic for protocol violations
              - Rogue access points, unauthorized clients, deauthentication attacks, and other wireless threats
              - Physical security of wireless access point hardware
              - Internet bandwidth usage by wireless clients

        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What do Protected Management Frames (PMF/802.11w) protect against?
            answer: Spoofing and forgery of management frames such as deauthentication and disassociation frames
            explanation: IEEE 802.11w (PMF) adds cryptographic protection to management frames, preventing attackers from sending forged deauthentication, disassociation, and other management frames. PMF is mandatory in WPA3 and optional in WPA2, mitigating deauth attacks.
            choices:
              - Data eavesdropping on encrypted wireless networks
              - Spoofing and forgery of management frames such as deauthentication and disassociation frames
              - Unauthorized access to the wireless network

      - concept: Wi-Fi site surveys for security
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why are wireless site surveys important for security?
            answer: They map signal coverage to identify areas of signal leakage, interference, and optimal access point placement to minimize exposure
            explanation: Wireless site surveys map RF signal strength and coverage throughout a facility. From a security perspective, they identify signal bleed beyond building boundaries (which attackers could exploit), co-channel interference, and optimal AP placement to provide coverage only where needed.
            choices:
              - They determine the fastest internet speed available at the site
              - They map signal coverage to identify areas of signal leakage, interference, and optimal access point placement to minimize exposure
              - They test the physical security of the building's entry points
              - They replace the need for wireless encryption
      - concept: KRACK attack against WPA2
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What vulnerability does the KRACK (Key Reinstallation Attack) exploit in WPA2?
            answer: A flaw in the four-way handshake that allows an attacker to force nonce reuse, enabling traffic decryption
            explanation: KRACK exploits a vulnerability in the WPA2 four-way handshake where an attacker can force the client to reinstall an already-in-use encryption key by replaying handshake messages. This causes nonce reuse, which can allow decryption and injection of traffic. Patches are available for most implementations.
            choices:
              - A weak random number generator used in WPA2 key derivation
              - A flaw in the four-way handshake that allows an attacker to force nonce reuse, enabling traffic decryption
              - A backdoor in the WPA2 encryption algorithm
              - An unpatched buffer overflow in WPA2 supplicant software
      - concept: Captive portals for guest wireless access
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the security purpose of a captive portal for guest wireless access?
            answer: To require guest users to agree to an acceptable use policy and authenticate before granting network access
            explanation: Captive portals intercept guest web requests and redirect them to an authentication or registration page. Guests must agree to acceptable use policies and/or provide credentials before gaining network access. This creates accountability and can segment guest traffic from the corporate network.
            choices:
              - To encrypt all guest traffic with WPA3
              - To require guest users to agree to an acceptable use policy and authenticate before granting network access
              - To block all internet access for guest users
              - To assign permanent IP addresses to guest devices

        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is SNMP (Simple Network Management Protocol) used for?
            answer: Monitoring and managing network devices by querying and receiving status information such as uptime, CPU usage, and interface errors
            explanation: SNMP enables monitoring tools to query network devices (routers, switches, servers) for operational data such as uptime, interface statistics, CPU/memory usage, and error counts. SNMP v3 should be used as it provides authentication and encryption; v1 and v2c send community strings in cleartext.
            choices:
              - Encrypting traffic between network devices
              - Monitoring and managing network devices by querying and receiving status information such as uptime, CPU usage, and interface errors
              - Authenticating users on the network

          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the purpose of syslog in network security?
            answer: To provide a standardized protocol for sending and collecting log messages from network devices and systems to a centralized server
            explanation: Syslog is a standard protocol for forwarding log messages from network devices, servers, and applications to a centralized log server or SIEM. Centralized logging is essential for security monitoring, correlation, and forensic investigation. Syslog typically uses UDP port 514 or TCP port 514.
            choices:
              - To encrypt network traffic between devices
              - To provide a standardized protocol for sending and collecting log messages from network devices and systems to a centralized server
              - To scan the network for open ports and vulnerabilities
              - To assign IP addresses to network devices
      - concept: Network performance monitoring vs. security monitoring
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does network security monitoring differ from network performance monitoring?
            answer: Security monitoring analyzes network activity for threats, vulnerabilities, and policy violations; performance monitoring focuses on availability and throughput
            explanation: Network security monitoring (NSM) focuses on detecting threats, anomalies, and policy violations by analyzing traffic patterns, logs, and alerts. Network performance monitoring focuses on availability, latency, throughput, and error rates. Both are complementary and important for network operations.
            choices:
              - Security monitoring focuses only on bandwidth utilization
              - Security monitoring analyzes network activity for threats, vulnerabilities, and policy violations; performance monitoring focuses on availability and throughput
              - Performance monitoring includes malware analysis while security monitoring does not
              - There is no difference; they are the same discipline
      - concept: Log retention and forensic readiness
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is log retention important for network security?
            answer: Retained logs enable forensic investigation of past incidents, support compliance requirements, and help identify long-term attack campaigns
            explanation: Log retention is critical because attacks are often discovered days, weeks, or months after initial compromise. Historical logs enable forensic reconstruction of incidents, identification of advanced persistent threats, and compliance with regulations that mandate specific retention periods.
            choices:
              - Logs are only needed for real-time monitoring and can be deleted immediately
              - Retained logs enable forensic investigation of past incidents, support compliance requirements, and help identify long-term attack campaigns
              - Log retention is only required for regulatory compliance and has no security benefit
              - Logs should be kept for exactly 24 hours and then deleted for privacy
      - concept: Network vulnerability scanning
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the purpose of network vulnerability scanning?
            answer: To identify known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and missing patches on network devices and systems
            explanation: Vulnerability scanners (like Nessus, Qualys, or OpenVAS) probe network devices, servers, and applications to identify known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, default credentials, and missing patches. Regular scanning helps organizations prioritize remediation before attackers can exploit these weaknesses.
            choices:
              - To block all network traffic until vulnerabilities are patched
              - To identify known vulnerabilities, misconfigurations, and missing patches on network devices and systems
              - To encrypt network traffic to prevent exploitation

            explanation: SOAR platforms automate and orchestrate security operations by integrating multiple security tools, automating repetitive tasks (such as enriching alerts with threat intelligence), and executing predefined playbooks for incident response. This reduces mean time to respond and alleviates analyst workload.
            choices:
              - Hardware-level encryption for all network traffic
              - Automated incident response workflows, integration of security tools, and orchestration of repetitive security tasks
              - Physical access control for server rooms
              - Backup and disaster recovery for security logs
      - concept: Threat hunting on the network
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What distinguishes threat hunting from traditional security monitoring?
            answer: Threat hunting is a proactive, analyst-driven process of searching for hidden threats that have evaded automated detection
            explanation: Threat hunting is a proactive approach where skilled analysts form hypotheses about potential threats and actively search through network traffic, logs, and endpoint data for indicators of compromise. It goes beyond passive alerting to uncover advanced threats that evade automated detection.
            choices:
              - Threat hunting relies exclusively on automated alerts from security tools
              - Threat hunting is a proactive, analyst-driven process of searching for hidden threats that have evaded automated detection
              - Threat hunting only examines endpoint logs, not network traffic
              - Threat hunting replaces the need for SIEM systems
      - concept: Network topology mapping for security
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is maintaining an accurate network topology map important for security?
            answer: It provides visibility into all connected devices, connections, and segments, enabling identification of unauthorized assets and attack paths
            explanation: An accurate network topology map provides a comprehensive view of all devices, connections, and network segments. Security teams use it to identify shadow IT, unauthorized devices, misconfigured segments, and potential attack paths. It is essential for incident response and attack surface management.
            choices:
              - It allows the network to run faster by optimizing cable routes
              - It provides visibility into all connected devices, connections, and segments, enabling identification of unauthorized assets and attack paths
              - It replaces the need for network segmentation
              - It automatically configures firewall rules based on the topology
      - concept: NTP security and time synchronization
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is accurate time synchronization (NTP) critical for network security monitoring?
            answer: Accurate timestamps across all devices enable proper log correlation, forensic analysis, and compliance with audit requirements
            explanation: Consistent, accurate timestamps are essential for correlating events across multiple devices and systems during incident investigation. If device clocks are out of sync, reconstructing the timeline of an attack becomes extremely difficult. NTP should be secured with authentication to prevent time-spoofing attacks.
            choices:
              - NTP prevents DDoS attacks by rate-limiting traffic
              - Accurate timestamps across all devices enable proper log correlation, forensic analysis, and compliance with audit requirements
              - NTP encrypts all log data during transmission
              - NTP automatically detects clock-based attacks on the network
      - concept: Honeypots and honeynets for threat detection
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the purpose of deploying a honeypot on a network?
            answer: To act as a decoy system that attracts attackers, enabling detection and analysis of attack methods
            explanation: A honeypot is a deliberately vulnerable decoy system designed to attract attackers. Any interaction with a honeypot is suspicious by definition, providing high-fidelity alerts. Honeypots help detect lateral movement, gather threat intelligence, and study attacker tactics without risking production systems.
            choices:
              - To provide backup storage for production data
              - To act as a decoy system that attracts attackers, enabling detection and analysis of attack methods
              - To increase network bandwidth for legitimate users
              - To serve as a secondary DNS resolver
      - concept: Full packet capture vs. metadata-only monitoring
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the trade-off between full packet capture and metadata-only (flow) monitoring?
            answer: Full packet capture preserves complete content for forensic analysis but requires significantly more storage; metadata monitoring is more storage-efficient but lacks payload details
            explanation: Full packet capture (FPC) records every byte of network traffic, providing the richest data for forensic analysis but requiring massive storage (potentially terabytes per day). Metadata/flow monitoring records only connection summaries, requiring far less storage but lacking the ability to reconstruct packet payloads.
            choices:
              - Full packet capture provides less detail but uses more storage
              - Full packet capture preserves complete content for forensic analysis but requires significantly more storage; metadata monitoring is more storage-efficient but lacks payload details
              - Metadata monitoring provides more detail than full packet capture
              - There is no difference in storage requirements between the two approaches
