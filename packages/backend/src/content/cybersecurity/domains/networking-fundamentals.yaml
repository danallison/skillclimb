            prompt: Explain the role of the Network Layer (Layer 3) in the OSI model. What are its main functions, and what devices and protocols operate at this layer?
            answer: "The Network Layer is responsible for logical addressing and routing. It assigns logical addresses (IP addresses) to devices so they can be identified across different networks. Its main functions include: (1) Logical Addressing - assigning IP addresses (IPv4 or IPv6) to uniquely identify devices. (2) Routing - determining the best path for packets to travel from source to destination across multiple networks using routing tables and algorithms. (3) Packet Forwarding - moving packets hop-by-hop through intermediate routers. (4) Fragmentation and Reassembly - breaking large packets into smaller fragments when they exceed a link's MTU, and reassembling them at the destination. Routers are the primary Layer 3 devices. Key protocols include IP (IPv4/IPv6), ICMP, OSPF, BGP, and RIP."
            explanation: The Network Layer handles logical addressing (IP addresses) and determines the best path for routing packets from source to destination across interconnected networks.

            prompt: Explain the role of the Application Layer (Layer 7) in the OSI model. What does it do, how does it differ from the layers below it, and what are some common protocols that operate at this layer?
            answer: "The Application Layer is the topmost layer (Layer 7) of the OSI model. It provides network services directly to end-user applications, serving as the interface between the user's software and the underlying network. Unlike the lower layers which handle data transport, addressing, and signal transmission, the Application Layer is concerned with application-level functionality such as web browsing, email, file transfer, and name resolution. Common protocols include: HTTP/HTTPS (web), SMTP (sending email), POP3/IMAP (receiving email), FTP (file transfer), DNS (domain name resolution), SSH (secure remote access), SNMP (network management), and DHCP (dynamic configuration). The Application Layer does not refer to the applications themselves but rather to the protocols and services that applications use to communicate over the network."
            explanation: The Application Layer (Layer 7) is the topmost OSI layer and provides network services directly to end-user applications, including protocols like HTTP, SMTP, FTP, and DNS.

            prompt: How does a TCP connection normally terminate?
            answer: Both sides exchange FIN and ACK segments in a four-way handshake
            explanation: "A graceful TCP connection termination uses a four-way handshake: one side sends FIN, the other ACKs, then sends its own FIN, which is ACKed by the first side."
            choices:
              - One side sends a RST and the connection closes immediately
              - Both sides exchange FIN and ACK segments in a four-way handshake
              - The server sends a single FIN and the client closes
              - A timeout expires and both sides drop the connection

          - type: recognition
            prompt: How does a host discover the MAC address of another device on the same local network using ARP?
            answer: It broadcasts an ARP request to all devices; the target replies with its MAC address
            explanation: ARP works by broadcasting a request ("Who has IP x.x.x.x? Tell me.") to all devices on the local segment. The device with the matching IP responds with a unicast reply containing its MAC address.
            choices:
              - It sends a unicast ARP request directly to the target's IP address
              - It broadcasts an ARP request to all devices; the target replies with its MAC address
              - It queries the DNS server for the MAC address
              - It checks a centralized DHCP table for the mapping

            explanation: A stateful firewall maintains a connection state table, allowing it to automatically permit return traffic for established connections. A stateless firewall evaluates each packet against its rules independently with no memory of prior packets.
            choices:
              - Stateful firewalls only work at Layer 7; stateless firewalls work at Layer 3
              - Stateful firewalls track active connections and allow return traffic; stateless firewalls evaluate each packet independently
              - Stateless firewalls are more secure because they inspect packet payloads
              - Stateless firewalls maintain a connection table; stateful firewalls do not

            prompt: What does the 'implicit deny' rule at the end of a firewall ruleset mean?
            answer: Any traffic that does not match an explicit allow rule is dropped by default
            explanation: An implicit deny (also called default deny) means that if no explicit rule matches a packet, the firewall drops it. This is a security best practice that ensures only intentionally permitted traffic is allowed through.
            choices:
              - All traffic is allowed unless a specific deny rule matches
              - Any traffic that does not match an explicit allow rule is dropped by default
              - The firewall logs denied traffic but still forwards it
              - Only DNS traffic is denied by default

            prompt: What is the purpose of a DMZ (Demilitarized Zone) in network security?
            answer: To host public-facing services in an isolated subnet between the external and internal networks
            explanation: A DMZ is a network segment that sits between an organization's internal network and the internet. It hosts public-facing services (web servers, mail servers) while limiting direct access to the internal network if a DMZ host is compromised.
            choices:
              - To provide a VLAN exclusively for management traffic
              - To host public-facing services in an isolated subnet between the external and internal networks
              - To store encrypted backups of firewall configurations
              - To connect two internal LANs without routing
      - concept: Ingress and egress filtering

            prompt: What is egress filtering on a firewall?
            answer: Inspecting and controlling outbound traffic leaving the network
            explanation: Egress filtering examines outbound traffic leaving a network, helping to prevent data exfiltration, block command-and-control communications, and stop internal hosts from sending spoofed packets.
            choices:
              - Inspecting and controlling outbound traffic leaving the network
              - Blocking all inbound traffic from the internet
              - Scanning internal traffic for malware signatures
              - Encrypting traffic before it exits the network
