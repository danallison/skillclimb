      - concept: The root directory and filesystem hierarchy
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the top-level directory in the Linux filesystem hierarchy?
            answer: /
            explanation: The forward slash (/) is the root of the entire Linux filesystem hierarchy. Every other file and directory is located beneath it. The /root directory is the home directory for the root user, which is different from the filesystem root.
            choices:
              - /home
              - /root
              - /
              - /usr

            prompt: What single character represents the top-level (root) directory of the entire Linux filesystem hierarchy?
            answer: /
            explanation: The forward slash (/) is the root of the entire Linux filesystem hierarchy. Every other file and directory is located beneath it. The /root directory is the home directory for the root user, which is different from the filesystem root.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - /
              - forward slash
              - slash
            hints:
              - It is a single punctuation character also used as the path separator.
              - Every absolute path in Linux begins with this character.

            prompt: Explain the Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS). What is the root directory, and describe the purpose of at least four major top-level directories beneath it.
            answer: "The Linux Filesystem Hierarchy Standard defines the directory structure of Linux systems. The root directory (/) is the top-level directory from which all other directories branch. Key directories include: /etc for system-wide configuration files, /home for user home directories, /var for variable data like logs and mail spools, /tmp for temporary files, /usr for read-only user programs and libraries, /bin for essential user commands, /sbin for system administration commands, /dev for device files, and /proc for virtual kernel/process information."
            explanation: The forward slash (/) is the root of the entire Linux filesystem hierarchy. Every other file and directory is located beneath it. The /root directory is the home directory for the root user, which is different from the filesystem root.
            hints:
              - Think about where configuration, user data, and logs are stored.
              - The standard is called the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS).
            rubric: A good answer should identify / as the root, explain that it is the top of the hierarchy, and correctly describe the purpose of at least four subdirectories such as /etc, /home, /var, /tmp, /usr, /bin, /sbin, /dev, or /proc.
            keyPoints:
              - / (root) is the top-level directory containing all others
              - /etc stores system-wide configuration files
              - /home contains user home directories
              - /var holds variable data such as logs
              - /usr contains read-only user programs and libraries
      - concept: The /etc directory and system configuration files
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which directory in Linux contains system-wide configuration files?
            answer: /etc
            explanation: The /etc directory holds system-wide configuration files such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/hosts, and /etc/fstab. Attackers often target this directory during post-exploitation to harvest credentials and understand system configuration.
            choices:
              - /var
              - /etc
              - /opt
              - /usr
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: What is the absolute path of the Linux directory that stores system-wide configuration files such as passwd, shadow, and hosts?
            answer: /etc
            explanation: The /etc directory holds system-wide configuration files such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/hosts, and /etc/fstab. Attackers often target this directory during post-exploitation to harvest credentials and understand system configuration.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - /etc
              - /etc/
              - etc
            hints:
              - This three-letter directory name is directly under the root (/).
              - Files like passwd, shadow, and fstab live here.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Describe the /etc directory in Linux. What is its purpose, name several important files it contains, and explain why attackers often target this directory during post-exploitation.
            answer: The /etc directory stores system-wide configuration files that control how the operating system and services behave. Important files include /etc/passwd (user account information), /etc/shadow (hashed passwords), /etc/hosts (hostname-to-IP mappings), /etc/fstab (filesystem mount configuration), /etc/sudoers (sudo privilege rules), and /etc/ssh/sshd_config (SSH server settings). Attackers target /etc during post-exploitation because it contains credential data (passwd/shadow), network configuration, service configurations, and privilege escalation opportunities (sudoers).
            explanation: The /etc directory holds system-wide configuration files such as /etc/passwd, /etc/shadow, /etc/hosts, and /etc/fstab. Attackers often target this directory during post-exploitation to harvest credentials and understand system configuration.
            hints:
              - Think about where Linux stores user account and password information.
              - Consider what an attacker would want to read after gaining access to a system.
            rubric: A good answer should explain that /etc holds system-wide configuration, name at least three important files with their purposes, and explain the security relevance of the directory.
            keyPoints:
              - /etc stores system-wide configuration files
              - /etc/passwd contains user account information
              - /etc/shadow contains hashed passwords and is a prime attacker target
              - /etc/hosts maps hostnames to IP addresses
              - Attackers target /etc for credential harvesting and understanding system configuration
      - concept: The /var directory and variable data
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which Linux directory typically stores log files, mail spools, and other variable data that changes during system operation?
            answer: /var
            explanation: The /var directory contains variable data files including system logs (/var/log), mail (/var/mail), and print spools. Security analysts frequently examine /var/log for evidence of intrusions and suspicious activity.
            choices:
              - /tmp
              - /var
              - /opt
              - /usr
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: What is the absolute path of the Linux directory that contains variable data such as system logs, mail spools, and print queues?
            answer: /var
            explanation: The /var directory contains variable data files including system logs (/var/log), mail (/var/mail), and print spools. Security analysts frequently examine /var/log for evidence of intrusions and suspicious activity.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - /var
              - /var/
              - var
            hints:
              - The name is short for 'variable'.
              - System logs are stored under this directory at /___/log.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain the purpose of the /var directory in Linux. What types of data does it store, what are some important subdirectories, and why is /var/log particularly important for security analysts?
            answer: The /var directory stores variable data that changes during normal system operation, as opposed to static data in /usr. Important subdirectories include /var/log (system and application logs), /var/mail (user mailboxes), /var/spool (print and mail queues), /var/tmp (temporary files preserved between reboots), and /var/lib (state information for applications). /var/log is critical for security analysts because it contains logs like auth.log or secure (authentication attempts), syslog (system events), kern.log (kernel messages), and application-specific logs. These logs provide evidence of intrusions, brute-force attacks, privilege escalation attempts, and other suspicious activity.
            explanation: The /var directory contains variable data files including system logs (/var/log), mail (/var/mail), and print spools. Security analysts frequently examine /var/log for evidence of intrusions and suspicious activity.
            hints:
              - Think about what data on a Linux system changes frequently during operation.
              - Consider what a security analyst would examine when investigating an incident.
            rubric: A good answer should explain that /var holds variable/changing data, name at least three subdirectories with their purposes, and explain the security importance of /var/log with specific log file examples.
            keyPoints:
              - /var stores variable data that changes during system operation
              - /var/log contains system and application log files
              - /var/mail holds user mailboxes
              - /var/spool manages print and mail queues
              - Security analysts use /var/log to investigate intrusions and suspicious activity
      - concept: The /tmp directory and its security implications
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why is the /tmp directory a common target for attackers on Linux systems?
            answer: It is world-writable, allowing any user to create and execute files there
            explanation: The /tmp directory is world-writable by default, meaning any user can create files in it. Attackers often use /tmp to drop malicious payloads, scripts, or tools after gaining initial access. Mounting /tmp with noexec can mitigate this risk.
            choices:
              - It stores encrypted user passwords
              - It is world-writable, allowing any user to create and execute files there
              - It contains kernel modules that can be replaced
              - It holds backup copies of the /etc/shadow file
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: What mount option can be applied to /tmp to prevent execution of binaries and scripts placed there by attackers?
            answer: noexec
            explanation: The /tmp directory is world-writable by default, meaning any user can create files in it. Attackers often use /tmp to drop malicious payloads, scripts, or tools after gaining initial access. Mounting /tmp with noexec can mitigate this risk.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - noexec
              - the noexec mount option
              - noexec flag
              - noexec option
            hints:
              - It is a mount option that prevents files from being run as programs.
              - The option name literally means 'no execution'.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain why the /tmp directory is a security concern on Linux systems. Describe its default permissions, how attackers exploit it, and what hardening measures can be applied to mitigate the risk.
            answer: "The /tmp directory is world-writable (permission 1777 with the sticky bit) by default, meaning any user on the system can create, read, and write files there. Attackers exploit this by dropping malicious payloads, reverse shells, scripts, and exploitation tools into /tmp after gaining initial access, since they know any user account can write there. Hardening measures include: mounting /tmp as a separate partition with the noexec option (prevents binary/script execution), nosuid (prevents SUID bit abuse), and nodev (prevents device file creation). The sticky bit ensures users can only delete their own files in /tmp. Additionally, administrators can use tmpwatch or systemd-tmpfiles to regularly clean old files from /tmp."
            explanation: The /tmp directory is world-writable by default, meaning any user can create files in it. Attackers often use /tmp to drop malicious payloads, scripts, or tools after gaining initial access. Mounting /tmp with noexec can mitigate this risk.
            hints:
              - Consider what permissions /tmp has by default and what that allows any user to do.
              - Think about mount options that restrict what can happen with files in a directory.
            rubric: A good answer should explain that /tmp is world-writable, describe how attackers use it as a staging area for malicious files, and mention at least two hardening measures such as noexec, nosuid, separate partition, or regular cleanup.
            keyPoints:
              - /tmp is world-writable by default, allowing any user to create files
              - Attackers use /tmp to drop malicious payloads and tools after initial access
              - The noexec mount option prevents execution of files in /tmp
              - Additional hardening includes nosuid and nodev mount options
              - The sticky bit (1777) ensures users can only delete their own files
      - concept: The /proc filesystem and process information
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What type of filesystem is /proc in Linux?
            answer: A virtual filesystem that exposes kernel and process information
            explanation: The /proc filesystem is a virtual (pseudo) filesystem that does not exist on disk. It provides an interface to kernel data structures and per-process information. Analysts use files like /proc/[pid]/cmdline and /proc/[pid]/maps for live forensics.
            choices:
              - A standard ext4 filesystem for storing process binaries
              - A virtual filesystem that exposes kernel and process information
              - An encrypted filesystem for storing sensitive process data
              - A network filesystem for sharing process information across hosts
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: What is the name of the virtual filesystem in Linux that provides an interface to kernel data structures and per-process information, located at a top-level mount point?
            answer: /proc
            explanation: The /proc filesystem is a virtual (pseudo) filesystem that does not exist on disk. It provides an interface to kernel data structures and per-process information. Analysts use files like /proc/[pid]/cmdline and /proc/[pid]/maps for live forensics.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - /proc
              - /proc/
              - proc
              - procfs
              - the proc filesystem
            hints:
              - Its name is short for 'process'.
              - Each running process has a numbered subdirectory in this filesystem.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Describe the /proc filesystem in Linux. Explain what kind of filesystem it is, what information it exposes, give examples of useful files within it, and explain how security analysts use it for live forensics.
            answer: "The /proc filesystem is a virtual (pseudo) filesystem that does not exist on disk — its contents are generated dynamically by the kernel. It exposes kernel data structures and per-process information. Each running process has a numbered directory (/proc/[pid]/) containing files like cmdline (the command that started the process), maps (memory mappings), fd/ (open file descriptors), environ (environment variables), and status (process state and memory usage). System-wide information is also available, such as /proc/cpuinfo, /proc/meminfo, /proc/version, and /proc/net/. Security analysts use /proc for live forensics: examining /proc/[pid]/cmdline reveals what commands processes are running, /proc/[pid]/exe shows the actual binary, /proc/[pid]/maps reveals loaded libraries (useful for detecting injection), and /proc/[pid]/fd/ shows open files and network connections."
            explanation: The /proc filesystem is a virtual (pseudo) filesystem that does not exist on disk. It provides an interface to kernel data structures and per-process information. Analysts use files like /proc/[pid]/cmdline and /proc/[pid]/maps for live forensics.
            hints:
              - Think about what makes this filesystem different from ext4 or XFS.
              - Consider what information about a running process would be useful for an investigator.
            rubric: A good answer should explain that /proc is a virtual filesystem not stored on disk, describe the per-process directories, name at least three specific files and their contents, and explain at least one forensic use case.
            keyPoints:
              - /proc is a virtual (pseudo) filesystem not stored on disk
              - Each process has a /proc/[pid]/ directory with process details
              - /proc/[pid]/cmdline shows the command line of a process
              - /proc/[pid]/maps reveals memory mappings useful for detecting code injection
              - Security analysts use /proc for live forensics to examine running processes without specialized tools
      - concept: Hard links vs symbolic links
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the key difference between a hard link and a symbolic (soft) link in Linux?
            answer: A hard link points directly to the inode of a file; a symbolic link points to the file path
            explanation: A hard link is an additional directory entry pointing to the same inode as the original file. A symbolic link is a separate file that stores the path to the target. Deleting the original file breaks a symbolic link but does not affect a hard link.
            choices:
              - A hard link points directly to the inode of a file; a symbolic link points to the file path
              - A symbolic link can only reference directories; a hard link cannot
              - Hard links work across different filesystems; symbolic links do not
              - Symbolic links share the same inode number as the target file
      - concept: The /home directory and user data
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Where are individual user home directories typically located on a Linux system?
            answer: /home
            explanation: User home directories are typically stored under /home (e.g., /home/alice). Each user's home directory contains personal files, shell configuration files like .bashrc and .bash_history, and SSH keys in .ssh/, all of which are valuable to attackers.
            choices:
              - /usr/home
              - /home
              - /users
              - /var/users
      - concept: The /bin and /sbin directories
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the primary difference between /bin and /sbin on a Linux system?
            answer: /bin contains user commands; /sbin contains system administration commands typically requiring root privileges
            explanation: /bin holds essential user commands available to all users (ls, cp, cat), while /sbin holds system administration binaries (iptables, fdisk, ifconfig) that typically require root privileges. On modern systems, these are often symlinked to /usr/bin and /usr/sbin.
            choices:
              - /bin contains user commands; /sbin contains system administration commands typically requiring root privileges
              - /sbin is for shell scripts; /bin is for compiled binaries
              - /bin is for 32-bit binaries; /sbin is for 64-bit binaries
              - /sbin stores backup copies of /bin executables
      - concept: Inodes and file metadata
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What information does an inode store in a Linux filesystem?
            answer: File metadata including ownership, permissions, timestamps, and data block pointers
            explanation: "An inode stores metadata about a file: owner, group, permissions, timestamps (access, modification, change), file size, and pointers to the data blocks on disk. Notably, the filename is not stored in the inode but in the directory entry."
            choices:
              - The filename and its directory path
              - File metadata including ownership, permissions, timestamps, and data block pointers
              - Only the file contents in compressed form
              - The user's password hash associated with the file
      - concept: Common Linux filesystem types (ext4, XFS, Btrfs)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which filesystem is the default on most modern Linux distributions?
            answer: ext4
            explanation: ext4 (Fourth Extended Filesystem) is the default filesystem on most Linux distributions. It supports journaling for crash recovery, file sizes up to 16 TiB, and volumes up to 1 EiB. XFS and Btrfs are also common alternatives.
            choices:
              - NTFS
              - FAT32
              - ext4
              - HFS+
      - concept: The /dev directory and device files
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the /dev directory contain in Linux?
            answer: Device files that represent hardware and virtual devices
            explanation: The /dev directory contains special device files that represent hardware devices (e.g., /dev/sda for a hard disk) and virtual devices (e.g., /dev/null, /dev/random). In security contexts, /dev/null discards output and /dev/urandom provides cryptographic randomness.
            choices:
              - Development tools and compilers
              - Device files that represent hardware and virtual devices
              - Developer documentation and man pages
              - Temporary files created by development environments
      - concept: Mount points and the /etc/fstab file
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the purpose of the /etc/fstab file on a Linux system?
            answer: It defines filesystems to be automatically mounted at boot, including their mount points and options
            explanation: The /etc/fstab (filesystem table) file defines which filesystems are mounted automatically at boot and their options (e.g., noexec, nosuid, nodev). Proper fstab hardening is important for security, such as mounting /tmp with noexec to prevent execution of malicious files.
            choices:
              - It stores user account information
              - It defines filesystems to be automatically mounted at boot, including their mount points and options
              - It lists all currently running processes
              - It configures the system firewall rules
      - concept: The /usr directory and user programs
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the /usr directory hierarchy contain in Linux?
            answer: Read-only user programs, libraries, documentation, and shared resources
            explanation: "/usr (Unix System Resources) contains read-only user programs and data: /usr/bin for user commands, /usr/lib for libraries, /usr/share for architecture-independent data, and /usr/local for locally installed software. It is the largest directory hierarchy on most systems."
            choices:
              - User home directories and personal files
              - Read-only user programs, libraries, documentation, and shared resources
              - Temporary user session data
              - User-specific log files

        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: In Linux file permissions, what are the three categories of users that permissions apply to?
            answer: Owner, Group, Other
            explanation: "Linux file permissions are divided into three categories: Owner (the file's owner), Group (members of the file's group), and Other (everyone else). Each category can independently have read, write, and execute permissions."
            choices:
              - Admin, User, Guest
              - Owner, Group, Other
              - Root, Sudo, Normal
              - Read, Write, Execute
      - concept: Numeric (octal) permission notation
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: In Linux octal permission notation, what does the permission value 755 represent?
            answer: "Owner: read/write/execute, Group: read/execute, Other: read/execute"
            explanation: In octal notation, 7 = read(4) + write(2) + execute(1), and 5 = read(4) + execute(1). So 755 gives the owner full permissions (rwx) and grants group and other read and execute permissions (r-x).
            choices:
              - "Owner: read/write, Group: read, Other: none"
              - "Owner: read/write/execute, Group: read/execute, Other: read/execute"
              - "Owner: read/write/execute, Group: read/write, Other: read/write"
              - "Owner: read/execute, Group: write, Other: execute"
      - concept: The chmod command for changing permissions
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which command is used to change file permissions on a Linux system?
            answer: chmod
            explanation: The chmod (change mode) command modifies file permissions. It can use symbolic notation (chmod u+x file) or octal notation (chmod 755 file). Misconfigured permissions are a common security vulnerability.
            choices:
              - chown
              - chmod
              - chgrp
              - umask
      - concept: The SUID bit and its security implications
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the SUID (Set User ID) bit do when set on an executable file in Linux?
            answer: It causes the file to execute with the permissions of the file owner, regardless of who runs it
            explanation: When the SUID bit is set on an executable, it runs with the effective permissions of the file owner (often root) instead of the user who launched it. Finding SUID binaries (find / -perm -4000) is a key step in Linux privilege escalation.
            choices:
              - It prevents the file from being executed by non-root users
              - It causes the file to execute with the permissions of the file owner, regardless of who runs it
              - It encrypts the file so only the owner can read it
              - It logs all executions of the file to the system audit log
      - concept: The SGID bit on files and directories
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the effect of the SGID (Set Group ID) bit when applied to a directory?
            answer: Files created within the directory inherit the directory's group ownership
            explanation: When SGID is set on a directory, new files and subdirectories created within it inherit the group ownership of the parent directory rather than the creating user's primary group. This is useful for shared directories.
            choices:
              - Files created within the directory inherit the directory's group ownership
              - Only the group owner can list the directory contents
              - The directory becomes read-only for all group members
              - The directory is excluded from backup operations
      - concept: The sticky bit on directories
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the sticky bit do when set on a directory like /tmp?
            answer: It allows only the file owner, directory owner, or root to delete or rename files within it
            explanation: The sticky bit on a directory prevents users from deleting or renaming files owned by other users. This is essential for world-writable directories like /tmp, where without the sticky bit any user could delete any other user's files.
            choices:
              - It makes the directory hidden from non-root users
              - It allows only the file owner, directory owner, or root to delete or rename files within it
              - It compresses all files stored in the directory
              - It prevents any new files from being created in the directory
      - concept: The umask and default file permissions
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the umask value control on a Linux system?
            answer: The default permissions that are removed from newly created files and directories
            explanation: The umask is a bitmask that is subtracted from the system default permissions when creating new files and directories. For example, a umask of 022 removes write permission for group and other from new files, resulting in 644 for files and 755 for directories.
            choices:
              - The maximum number of files a user can create
              - The default permissions that are removed from newly created files and directories
              - The encryption algorithm used for file storage
              - The list of users who are denied login access
      - concept: The chown command for changing ownership
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the chown command do in Linux?
            answer: Changes the owner and/or group of a file or directory
            explanation: The chown (change owner) command modifies the owner and optionally the group of a file or directory (e.g., chown alice:developers file.txt). Only root can change file ownership on most systems.
            choices:
              - Changes the permissions (mode) of a file
              - Changes the owner and/or group of a file or directory
              - Changes the timestamp of a file
              - Changes the name of a file or directory
      - concept: The /etc/passwd file and user accounts
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What information is stored in the /etc/passwd file on a Linux system?
            answer: User account information including username, UID, GID, home directory, and default shell
            explanation: "The /etc/passwd file contains one line per user account with colon-separated fields: username, password placeholder (x), UID, GID, comment, home directory, and login shell. Despite its name, actual password hashes are stored in /etc/shadow."
            choices:
              - Encrypted user passwords and their expiration dates
              - User account information including username, UID, GID, home directory, and default shell
              - A log of all successful and failed login attempts
              - The list of users currently logged into the system
      - concept: The /etc/shadow file and password hashes
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Why are password hashes stored in /etc/shadow rather than /etc/passwd?
            answer: Because /etc/shadow is readable only by root, protecting password hashes from non-privileged users
            explanation: The /etc/shadow file is readable only by root (permissions 640 or 600), whereas /etc/passwd must be world-readable for system functionality. Moving password hashes to /etc/shadow prevents unprivileged users from obtaining hashes for offline cracking.
            choices:
              - Because /etc/shadow supports longer passwords
              - Because /etc/shadow is readable only by root, protecting password hashes from non-privileged users
              - Because /etc/passwd does not support any form of encryption
              - Because /etc/shadow automatically rotates passwords every 90 days
      - concept: The sudo command and privilege escalation
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the purpose of the sudo command in Linux?
            answer: To execute a command with the privileges of another user, typically root
            explanation: sudo (superuser do) allows authorized users to run commands as root or another user, as configured in /etc/sudoers. Misconfigured sudo rules are a top target for privilege escalation attacks on Linux systems.
            choices:
              - To switch to a different user's home directory
              - To execute a command with the privileges of another user, typically root
              - To encrypt a command before execution
              - To schedule a command to run at a later time
      - concept: The /etc/sudoers file and sudo configuration
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which file controls which users and groups are permitted to use sudo, and what commands they may run?
            answer: /etc/sudoers
            explanation: "The /etc/sudoers file defines sudo policies: which users or groups may run which commands, on which hosts, and as which target users. It should only be edited with the visudo command, which validates syntax before saving."
            choices:
              - /etc/passwd
              - /etc/sudo.conf
              - /etc/sudoers
              - /etc/security/access.conf
      - concept: Access Control Lists (ACLs) in Linux
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What do Linux Access Control Lists (ACLs) provide beyond standard file permissions?
            answer: Fine-grained permission control for specific users and groups beyond owner/group/other
            explanation: Linux ACLs extend the traditional owner/group/other model by allowing permissions to be set for additional named users and groups on a per-file basis. The getfacl and setfacl commands manage ACLs.
            choices:
              - The ability to encrypt individual files at the filesystem level
              - Fine-grained permission control for specific users and groups beyond owner/group/other
              - Automatic permission inheritance from parent directories only
              - A mechanism to prevent root from accessing certain files
  - name: Linux Processes
    complexityWeight: 1.1
    nodes:
      - concept: The init/systemd process (PID 1)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which process always has PID 1 on a Linux system and is the ancestor of all other processes?
            answer: init or systemd
            explanation: The init process (or systemd on modern distributions) is the first user-space process started by the kernel and always has PID 1. It is the ancestor of all other processes and is responsible for starting and managing system services.
            choices:
              - bash
              - kernel
              - init or systemd
              - cron
      - concept: The ps command for viewing processes
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which command is commonly used to display a snapshot of currently running processes on a Linux system?
            answer: ps aux
            explanation: The 'ps aux' command displays a snapshot of all running processes with detailed information including user, PID, CPU usage, memory usage, and the command line. It is essential for security investigations and identifying suspicious processes.
            choices:
              - ls -l
              - ps aux
              - df -h
              - cat /proc/cpuinfo
      - concept: Process signals and the kill command
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the command 'kill -9 <PID>' do in Linux?
            answer: Sends SIGKILL to forcefully terminate the process immediately
            explanation: Signal 9 (SIGKILL) cannot be caught or ignored by a process; the kernel immediately terminates it. Unlike SIGTERM (signal 15), which allows a process to clean up before exiting, SIGKILL is a last resort when a process is unresponsive.
            choices:
              - Sends SIGHUP to gracefully restart the process
              - Sends SIGKILL to forcefully terminate the process immediately
              - Sends SIGSTOP to pause the process
              - Sends SIGTERM to request a graceful shutdown
      - concept: Foreground and background processes
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: In a Linux shell, how do you send a running foreground process to the background?
            answer: Press Ctrl+Z to suspend it, then type bg
            explanation: Ctrl+Z sends SIGTSTP to the foreground process, suspending it. The 'bg' command then resumes it in the background. The 'fg' command brings a background process back to the foreground. The '&' suffix starts a command directly in the background.
            choices:
              - Press Ctrl+C, then type bg
              - Press Ctrl+Z to suspend it, then type bg
              - Type 'background' followed by the PID
              - Press Ctrl+D to detach the process
      - concept: Daemons and background services
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is a daemon in the context of Linux systems?
            answer: A background process that runs continuously, typically providing a system service
            explanation: A daemon is a background process that runs without direct user interaction, typically started at boot to provide services such as web serving (httpd), logging (syslogd), or SSH access (sshd). Daemon names conventionally end with 'd'.
            choices:
              - A malicious process that hides from the user
              - A background process that runs continuously, typically providing a system service
              - A process that only runs when a user is logged in
              - A kernel module that manages hardware devices

        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: How can you view the exact command line used to start a process with PID 1234 on Linux?
            answer: cat /proc/1234/cmdline
            explanation: The /proc/[pid]/cmdline file contains the complete command line used to start a process, with arguments separated by null bytes. This is invaluable during incident response for understanding what a suspicious process is doing.
            choices:
              - cat /var/log/process/1234
              - cat /proc/1234/cmdline
              - cat /etc/process/1234.conf

      - concept: Process niceness and priority
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the 'nice' value of a Linux process control?
            answer: The CPU scheduling priority of the process
            explanation: The nice value ranges from -20 (highest priority) to 19 (lowest priority). A higher nice value means the process is 'nicer' to other processes by yielding CPU time. Only root can set negative nice values (higher priority).
            choices:
              - The amount of memory allocated to the process
              - The CPU scheduling priority of the process
              - The network bandwidth available to the process
              - The file access permissions of the process
      - concept: Zombie processes and process states
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is a zombie process in Linux?
            answer: A process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table because its parent has not collected its exit status
            explanation: A zombie process has finished executing but remains in the process table (state 'Z') until its parent calls wait() to read its exit status. Zombies consume minimal resources but a large number may indicate a poorly written or compromised parent process.
            choices:
              - A process that consumes excessive CPU resources
              - A process that has completed execution but still has an entry in the process table because its parent has not collected its exit status
              - A process that has been suspended by the kernel for security reasons
              - A process running in a container that has lost its network connection

        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the 'top' command display in Linux?
            answer: A real-time, dynamic view of running processes and system resource utilization
            explanation: The 'top' command provides a real-time, updating display of system processes sorted by CPU usage, along with overall CPU, memory, and swap utilization. It is commonly used during incident response to identify resource-intensive or suspicious processes.
            choices:
              - A list of the top 10 largest files on the system
              - A real-time, dynamic view of running processes and system resource utilization
              - The top-level directory structure of the filesystem
              - A list of the most recently modified configuration files
      - concept: The cron scheduler and crontab
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the purpose of cron on a Linux system?
            answer: To schedule commands or scripts to run automatically at specified times or intervals
            explanation: Cron is a time-based job scheduler that executes commands at specified intervals defined in crontab files. Attackers frequently install cron jobs for persistence, so reviewing crontabs (crontab -l, /etc/crontab, /etc/cron.d/) is essential during investigations.
            choices:
              - To monitor system logs for security events
              - To schedule commands or scripts to run automatically at specified times or intervals
              - To manage user authentication and session tracking
              - To compress and archive old files
      - concept: Process namespaces and containerization
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What do Linux namespaces provide in the context of process isolation?
            answer: Isolated views of system resources such as PIDs, network, and mount points for groups of processes
            explanation: Linux namespaces isolate groups of processes so they have their own view of system resources (PID, network, mount, user, UTS, IPC). Namespaces are the foundational technology behind containers like Docker and are critical to understanding container security.
            choices:
              - Encryption of process memory to prevent reading by other processes
              - Isolated views of system resources such as PIDs, network, and mount points for groups of processes
              - A mechanism to run processes on remote machines transparently
              - Automatic load balancing of processes across CPU cores
      - concept: The lsof command for listing open files
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the lsof command do in Linux, and why is it useful for security?
            answer: It lists open files and the processes that have them open, including network connections
            explanation: lsof (list open files) shows all files currently opened by processes, including regular files, directories, network sockets, and pipes. It is invaluable for identifying which process is using a port (lsof -i :80) or which files a suspicious process has open.
            choices:
              - It lists all files on the filesystem sorted by size
              - It lists open files and the processes that have them open, including network connections
              - It locks files to prevent simultaneous access by multiple users
              - It logs all file system operations to the audit log
      - concept: The strace command for system call tracing
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the strace utility do in Linux?
            answer: It intercepts and records system calls made by a process and the signals it receives
            explanation: strace traces system calls (open, read, write, connect, execve, etc.) made by a process. Security analysts use it to understand malware behavior, debug suspicious processes, and observe what files and network connections a program accesses.
            choices:
              - It traces network packets between two hosts
              - It intercepts and records system calls made by a process and the signals it receives
              - It traces the execution path through source code

      - concept: iptables and Linux firewall management
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is iptables in Linux?
            answer: A user-space utility for configuring the kernel's packet filtering rules (firewall)
            explanation: iptables is the traditional user-space tool for configuring the Linux kernel's Netfilter packet filtering framework. It organizes rules into chains (INPUT, OUTPUT, FORWARD) within tables (filter, nat, mangle). nftables is its modern successor.
            choices:
              - A tool for managing DNS records
              - A user-space utility for configuring the kernel's packet filtering rules (firewall)
              - A network monitoring tool that captures packets
              - A service that assigns IP addresses via DHCP
      - concept: The /etc/hosts file and local name resolution
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What role does the /etc/hosts file play on a Linux system?
            answer: It provides static hostname-to-IP address mappings that override DNS
            explanation: The /etc/hosts file maps hostnames to IP addresses locally, and is typically consulted before DNS (depending on /etc/nsswitch.conf). Attackers may modify it to redirect traffic, and defenders use it to block known malicious domains by pointing them to 127.0.0.1.

            prompt: In Bash, what does the syntax $(command) do?
            answer: It runs the command and substitutes its output into the surrounding command
            explanation: Command substitution $(command) executes the enclosed command and replaces the expression with its stdout. For example, 'echo "Today is $(date)"' embeds the current date. The older backtick syntax `command` is equivalent but harder to nest and read.
            choices:
              - It defines a new function named 'command'
              - It runs the command and substitutes its output into the surrounding command
              - It runs the command in a subshell without capturing output
              - It creates a variable named after the command
