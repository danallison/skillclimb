            prompt: Which element of the CIA triad is concerned with preventing unauthorized disclosure of information?
            answer: Confidentiality
            explanation: Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals. Encryption, access controls, and data classification are common mechanisms for enforcing confidentiality.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - confidentiality
              - Confidentiality
            hints:
              - Think about what it means to keep a secret.
              - This principle is enforced through encryption and access controls.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain what confidentiality means in the context of the CIA triad and describe at least two mechanisms used to enforce it.
            answer: Confidentiality is the principle that information should only be accessible to those who are authorized to view it. It prevents unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data. Common mechanisms for enforcing confidentiality include encryption (converting data into an unreadable format without the proper key), access controls (restricting who can access resources based on roles or permissions), and data classification (labeling data by sensitivity level to apply appropriate protections).
            explanation: Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is accessed only by authorized individuals. Encryption, access controls, and data classification are common mechanisms for enforcing confidentiality.
            hints:
              - Think about what happens when sensitive data falls into the wrong hands.
              - Consider both technical controls (like encryption) and administrative controls (like classification policies).
            rubric: A good answer should define confidentiality as preventing unauthorized access or disclosure, and identify at least two enforcement mechanisms such as encryption, access controls, data classification, or data masking.
            keyPoints:
              - Confidentiality prevents unauthorized disclosure of information
              - Encryption transforms data so only authorized parties can read it

            acceptableAnswers:
              - integrity
              - Integrity
              - data integrity
            hints:
              - Think about what guarantees that data remains accurate and trustworthy.
              - Hash functions and digital signatures are commonly used to verify this property.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain what integrity means in the CIA triad and describe how organizations detect or prevent unauthorized data modifications.
            answer: "Integrity in the CIA triad means ensuring that data remains accurate, complete, and unaltered except through authorized processes. Organizations use several mechanisms to protect integrity: hash functions generate a fixed-size fingerprint of data that changes if even one bit is modified, digital signatures combine hashing with asymmetric encryption to verify both the source and integrity of data, checksums provide a simpler verification that data has not been corrupted, and version control and audit logs track all changes to detect unauthorized modifications."
            explanation: Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered except by authorized changes. Hash functions, digital signatures, and checksums are used to detect unauthorized modifications.
            hints:
              - Consider what would happen if someone silently changed a financial record or medical file.
              - Think about cryptographic tools that can detect even the smallest change to data.
            rubric: A good answer should define integrity as ensuring data accuracy and preventing unauthorized modification, and describe at least two detection or prevention mechanisms such as hashing, digital signatures, checksums, or audit trails.
            keyPoints:
              - Integrity ensures data accuracy and prevents unauthorized modification
              - Hash functions detect changes by producing a unique fingerprint of data
              - Digital signatures verify both the source and integrity of data

            prompt: A distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attack takes a company's website offline for several hours. Which element of the CIA triad is primarily affected?
            answer: Availability
            explanation: Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed. DDoS attacks directly target availability by overwhelming resources so legitimate users cannot access the service.
            choices:
              - Availability
              - Confidentiality
              - Integrity
              - Authentication
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: Which element of the CIA triad is compromised when authorized users are unable to access a system or its data when they need it?
            answer: Availability
            explanation: Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed. DDoS attacks directly target availability by overwhelming resources so legitimate users cannot access the service.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - availability
              - Availability
            hints:
              - Think about what happens during a DDoS attack or a major system outage.
              - This principle is about ensuring systems are up and running when needed.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain what availability means in the CIA triad and describe common threats to availability along with defenses against them.
            answer: Availability is the principle that systems, networks, and data must be accessible to authorized users whenever they are needed. Common threats to availability include distributed denial-of-service (DDoS) attacks that overwhelm resources with traffic, hardware failures, natural disasters, and ransomware that locks users out of their data. Defenses include redundancy and failover systems, load balancing to distribute traffic, regular backups and disaster recovery plans, DDoS mitigation services, and uninterruptible power supplies (UPS) to handle power outages.
            explanation: Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed. DDoS attacks directly target availability by overwhelming resources so legitimate users cannot access the service.
            hints:
              - Think about what could prevent you from accessing a critical system and what safeguards could help.
              - Consider both intentional attacks and unintentional failures that affect system uptime.
            rubric: A good answer should define availability as ensuring timely access for authorized users, identify at least two threats (such as DDoS, hardware failure, or natural disasters), and describe at least two defensive measures.
            keyPoints:
              - Availability ensures authorized users can access systems and data when needed
              - DDoS attacks are a primary threat that overwhelms resources with traffic
              - Redundancy and failover systems help maintain uptime during failures
              - Regular backups and disaster recovery plans protect against data loss
              - Load balancing distributes traffic to prevent any single point of overload

              - confidentiality, integrity, availability
              - confidentiality integrity availability
              - C I A
            hints:
              - The acronym CIA stands for three words, each representing a core security goal.
              - One is about keeping secrets, one is about accuracy, and one is about uptime.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Describe the CIA triad and explain how each of its three components contributes to a comprehensive information security strategy.
            answer: "The CIA triad is the foundational model of information security, consisting of three core principles: Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is only accessible to authorized individuals, using mechanisms like encryption, access controls, and data classification. Integrity ensures that data remains accurate and unaltered except through authorized processes, using tools like hash functions, digital signatures, and audit trails. Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible to authorized users when needed, supported by redundancy, backups, disaster recovery planning, and DDoS mitigation. Together, these three principles guide the design and evaluation of security policies and controls."
            explanation: The CIA triad is the foundational model in information security. Confidentiality protects data from unauthorized disclosure, integrity ensures data accuracy, and availability ensures systems are accessible when needed.
            hints:
              - Think of three words that start with C, I, and A.
              - Consider what could go wrong if any one of these three properties were violated.
            rubric: A good answer should name all three components, define each one clearly, and explain how they work together to form a comprehensive security model. Bonus for providing examples of mechanisms that support each component.
            keyPoints:
              - Confidentiality prevents unauthorized disclosure of information
              - Integrity ensures data remains accurate and unmodified by unauthorized parties
              - Availability ensures systems and data are accessible when needed
              - The three components together form the foundational model of information security
              - Each component is supported by specific technical and administrative controls
      - concept: Non-repudiation
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which security property prevents a sender from denying that they sent a message?
            answer: Non-repudiation
            explanation: Non-repudiation provides proof of the origin and integrity of data, making it impossible for the sender to deny having sent it. Digital signatures are the primary mechanism for achieving non-repudiation.
            choices:
              - Non-repudiation
              - Confidentiality
              - Availability
              - Obfuscation
          - type: cued_recall
            prompt: What security property ensures that someone cannot deny having performed an action, such as sending a message or signing a document?
            answer: Non-repudiation
            explanation: Non-repudiation provides proof of the origin and integrity of data, making it impossible for the sender to deny having sent it. Digital signatures are the primary mechanism for achieving non-repudiation.
            acceptableAnswers:
              - non-repudiation
              - Non-repudiation
              - nonrepudiation
            hints:
              - This property is closely related to accountability and proof of origin.
              - Digital signatures are the primary cryptographic mechanism for achieving this.
          - type: free_recall
            prompt: Explain the concept of non-repudiation in cybersecurity, why it matters, and how it is typically achieved.
            answer: "Non-repudiation is the security property that ensures a party involved in a communication or transaction cannot deny having performed that action. It provides irrefutable proof of origin and delivery. This matters because in legal, financial, and contractual contexts, parties must be held accountable for their actions. Non-repudiation is primarily achieved through digital signatures, which use asymmetric cryptography: the sender signs a message with their private key, and anyone can verify the signature using the sender's public key. Since only the sender possesses their private key, they cannot plausibly deny having created the signature. Audit logs, timestamps, and certificates from a Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) further support non-repudiation."
            explanation: Non-repudiation provides proof of the origin and integrity of data, making it impossible for the sender to deny having sent it. Digital signatures are the primary mechanism for achieving non-repudiation.
            hints:
              - Think about what would happen in a legal dispute if someone could deny signing a contract.
              - Consider how asymmetric cryptography (public/private key pairs) can prove who created a message.
            rubric: A good answer should define non-repudiation as the inability to deny an action, explain its importance for accountability, and describe the role of digital signatures (and optionally PKI or audit logs) in achieving it.
            keyPoints:
              - Non-repudiation prevents a party from denying they performed an action
              - It provides proof of origin and delivery of data
              - Digital signatures are the primary mechanism for achieving non-repudiation
              - It is essential for legal, financial, and contractual accountability
              - PKI, audit logs, and timestamps provide additional non-repudiation support
  - name: Authentication & Authorization
    complexityWeight: 1.2
    nodes:
      - concept: Authentication vs. authorization
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the primary difference between authentication and authorization?
            answer: Authentication verifies identity; authorization determines access permissions
            explanation: Authentication (AuthN) confirms who a user is, while authorization (AuthZ) determines what that verified user is allowed to do. Authentication must occur before authorization.
            choices:
              - Authentication verifies identity; authorization determines access permissions
              - Authentication determines access permissions; authorization verifies identity
              - Authentication encrypts data; authorization decrypts data
              - Authentication and authorization are the same process
      - concept: Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which combination represents true multi-factor authentication?
            answer: A password and a one-time code from an authenticator app
            explanation: "True MFA requires factors from different categories: something you know (password), something you have (authenticator app), or something you are (biometric). A password plus a security question are both 'something you know,' so that is single-factor."
            choices:
              - A password and a one-time code from an authenticator app
              - A password and a security question
              - A fingerprint scan and a retina scan
              - A PIN and a password
      - concept: Authentication factors
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: A fingerprint scanner used for login is an example of which authentication factor?
            answer: Something you are
            explanation: Biometric identifiers like fingerprints, retina patterns, and facial geometry fall under the 'something you are' factor. This category relies on inherent physical or behavioral characteristics unique to the individual.
            choices:
              - Something you are
              - Something you know
              - Something you have
              - Somewhere you are
      - concept: OAuth 2.0
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the primary purpose of OAuth 2.0?
            answer: Delegated authorization — allowing a third-party application to access resources on behalf of a user
            explanation: OAuth 2.0 is an authorization framework that enables third-party applications to obtain limited access to a user's resources without exposing their credentials. It issues access tokens rather than sharing passwords.
            choices:
              - Delegated authorization — allowing a third-party application to access resources on behalf of a user
              - Encrypting data at rest on a database server
              - Scanning networks for open ports and vulnerabilities
              - Establishing a VPN tunnel between two networks
      - concept: Single sign-on (SSO)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is a primary benefit of single sign-on (SSO) for an organization?
            answer: Users authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without re-entering credentials
            explanation: SSO allows users to log in once and access multiple related systems. This reduces password fatigue, lowers help-desk costs for password resets, and can improve security by centralizing authentication policy enforcement.
            choices:
              - Users authenticate once and gain access to multiple applications without re-entering credentials
              - Each application maintains its own independent credential store
              - Users must create unique passwords for every application
              - It eliminates the need for any form of authentication
      - concept: Principle of least privilege
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What does the principle of least privilege state?
            answer: Users should be granted only the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions
            explanation: The principle of least privilege limits each user's access rights to the bare minimum needed for their role. This reduces the attack surface and limits the potential damage from compromised accounts or insider threats.
            choices:
              - Users should be granted only the minimum access necessary to perform their job functions
              - All users should have administrator-level access to simplify management
              - Privileges should be assigned based on seniority within the organization
              - Access rights should be reviewed only during annual audits
  - name: Access Control
    complexityWeight: 1.3
    nodes:
      - concept: Role-based access control (RBAC)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: In role-based access control (RBAC), how are permissions assigned?
            answer: Permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to roles
            explanation: RBAC assigns permissions to defined roles (e.g., 'editor,' 'auditor') rather than to individual users. Users inherit permissions through their role assignments, simplifying administration in large organizations.
            choices:
              - Permissions are assigned to roles, and users are assigned to roles
              - Permissions are assigned directly to individual users
              - The resource owner decides who can access each resource
              - A central authority assigns security labels to data and users
      - concept: Mandatory access control (MAC)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which access control model uses security labels (e.g., Top Secret, Secret, Confidential) enforced by a central authority?
            answer: Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
            explanation: MAC assigns security labels to both subjects and objects, and a central authority enforces access rules based on those labels. It is commonly used in military and government environments where strict data classification is required.
            choices:
              - Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
              - Discretionary Access Control (DAC)
              - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
              - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
      - concept: Discretionary access control (DAC)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: In discretionary access control (DAC), who determines access to a resource?
            answer: The resource owner
            explanation: "In DAC, the owner of a resource decides who is granted access. Standard Unix file permissions are a classic example: the file owner can set read, write, and execute permissions for owner, group, and others."
            choices:
              - The resource owner
              - A central security administrator
              - The operating system kernel exclusively
              - An automated risk scoring engine
      - concept: Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: Which access control model evaluates policies based on attributes of the user, resource, action, and environment?
            answer: Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
            explanation: ABAC makes access decisions by evaluating attributes (user department, resource sensitivity, time of day, location, etc.) against policies. This provides fine-grained, context-aware access control beyond what static roles can express.
            choices:
              - Attribute-Based Access Control (ABAC)
              - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
              - Mandatory Access Control (MAC)
              - Rule-Based Access Control
      - concept: Separation of duties
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: What is the goal of separation of duties in access control?
            answer: To require more than one person to complete a critical task, preventing fraud or error
            explanation: Separation of duties divides critical functions among multiple people so that no single individual can complete a high-risk action alone. For example, the person who requests a payment should not be the same person who approves it.
            choices:
              - To require more than one person to complete a critical task, preventing fraud or error
              - To ensure all employees share the same access level for transparency
              - To assign all critical functions to the most senior employee
              - To allow any employee to substitute for any other in an emergency
  - name: Risk Assessment
    complexityWeight: 1.4
    nodes:
      - concept: Risk definition
        questions:
          - type: recognition
            prompt: In cybersecurity, risk is most accurately defined as the combination of which two factors?
            answer: The likelihood of a threat exploiting a vulnerability and the resulting impact
